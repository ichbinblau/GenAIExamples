Dáil almost suspended after Sinn Féin TD put pager in front of Minister during firefighters debate,2023-06-15T14:32:11.000000000+00:00,"The Dáil was almost suspended on Thursday afternoon after Sinn Féin TD John Brady walked across the chamber and placed an on-call pager in front of the Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien during a debate on retained firefighters.
Mr O’Brien said Mr Brady had taken part in “an act of theatre” that was “obviously choreographed”.
Around 2,000 retained firefighters around the country staged a second day of industrial action on Tuesday and are due to start all out-strike action from next Tuesday. The mostly part-time workers, who keep the services going outside of Ireland’s larger urban centres, are taking industrial action in a dispute over pay and working conditions.
Speaking in the Dáil, Sinn Féin deputy leader Pearse Doherty said firefighters had marched on Leinster House today and were “very angry” at “the fact the Government will not intervene”.

“An intervention is required now. I’m asking you to make an improved offer in relation to pay for retained firefighters,” Mr Doherty told the housing minister.
“I’m also asking you, and challenging you, to go outside after this Order of Business and meet with the firefighters because they are just fed up to the hilt in relation to what you said.
“Some of them have handed in their pagers to members of the Opposition and have challenged you to wear the pager for the next number of weeks, put up with an €8,600 retainer and not leave your community for the two and a half kilometres and see how you can stand over those type of pay and conditions.”
At this point, Mr Brady got up from his seat, walked across the chamber and placed the pager on the desk in front of Mr O’Brien. Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl said the Sinn Féin TD was “completely out of order” and told him not to “carry out a charade in this House”, adding it was “absolutely outrageous behaviour and not to be encouraged”.
Mr O’Brien said Mr Brady had engaged in “an act of theatre here today which was obviously choreographed” and was then interrupted with shouts from the Opposition benches. Mr Ó Fearghaíl said he would suspend the House “if this racket continues”.
Mr O’Brien later said he said he was confident the dispute could be resolved and he had “immense regard” for firefighters. The minister said he would encourage the unions to re-engage with the State’s industrial relations process while also accusing Sinn Féin of using the issue for their “own political gain”.
“You see what happened here today, you’re shameless and people see through it,” he told Mr Doherty."
Epic’s latest tool can animate hyperrealistic MetaHumans with an iPhone,2023-06-15T14:00:00.000000000+00:00,"Today, Epic is releasing a new tool designed to capture an actor’s facial performance using a device as simple as an iPhone and apply it to a hyperrealistic “MetaHuman” in the Unreal Engine in “minutes.” The feature, dubbed MetaHuman Animator, was detailed at the Game Developers Conference in March but is now available for developers to try out for themselves. Epic has also released a new video today produced by one of its internal teams to show what the tool is capable of.
While Epic’s short film shows off some impressively subtle facial animation, the big benefit the company is emphasizing is the speed with which MetaHuman Animator produces results. “The animation is produced locally using GPU hardware, with the final animation available in minutes,” the company’s press release reads. That has the potential to not just save a studio money by making performance capture more efficient but also, Epic argues, it could allow them to experiment and be more creative.
“Need an actor to give you more, dig into a different emotion, or simply explore a new direction?” Epic’s press release asks. “Have them do another take. You’ll be able to review the results in about the time it takes to make a cup of coffee.” Facial animation can be applied to a MetaHuman character “in just a few clicks,” Epic says, and the system is even smart enough to animate a character’s tongue based on the performance’s audio.
Performance capture using iPhones has been possible in the Unreal Engine since at least 2020 with the launch of Epic’s Live Link Face iOS app, but now, it’s combined with the high level of detail promised by Epic’s MetaHuman technology. As well as working on the iPhone 12 and up (which is capable of capturing both video and depth data), Epic says MetaHuman Animator can also be used with “existing vertical stereo head-mounted camera [systems] to achieve even greater fidelity.”
Epic says the Blue Dot short film released today should give some idea of what its animation tool is capable of. It was produced by Epic Games’ 3Lateral team and stars actor Radivoje Bukvić delivering a monologue based on a poem by Mika Antić. Although Epic says it’s possible to tweak animation post-capture, it claims “minimal interventions” were made on top of the MetaHuman Animator’s performance capture to achieve these results.
If you want to learn more, Epic has released an instructional video on how to use the tool. Documentation is also available via the MetaHuman hub on the Epic Developer Community."
"EU to Ban Huawei, ZTE from Internal Commission Networks",2023-06-15T13:50:00.000000000+00:00,"The European Commission is planning to ban equipment from Chinese vendors Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp. from its own internal telecommunications networks, people familiar with the matter said.
The ban comes ahead of an anticipated update to the European Union’s guidance on 5G mobile networks within the bloc that’s expected to more forcefully encourage members to phase out equipment from the companies, which it considers high risk, the people said, asking not to be identified because the plan isn’t yet public.
As the relationship between the US and its allies and China has deteriorated, countries have blocked Chinese technology from their core telecommunications networks because of spying concerns. The move is similar to the commission’s decision to block its staff from using TikTok Inc. over security concerns related to the social-media app’s data-collection practices.
Read More: TikTok Banned From EU Commission Phones Amid Security Fears
In the EU’s review of the 5G “toolbox,” the commission will say that publicly excluding Huawei and ZTE from national networks is justified and will explicitly call out Huawei and ZTE as high-risk vendors by name for the first time. The majority of countries have yet to ban the two Chinese vendors from their networks.
Representatives for Huawei and ZTE didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

"Arsenal have Rice bid rejected, new Premier League fixtures released, Man United out of Harry Kane race, Chelsea reject Mason Mount bid",2023-06-15T13:31:42.000000000+00:00,"Jude Bellingham has also insisted his move to Real Madrid had nothing to do with money, as he explained how his transfer was wrapped up so quickly.
“Money is not a thing for me,” he said.
“I dont think about money at all when I make these kinds of decisions. I never have and I never will. I play the game purely out of love.
“I spoke with people from Real Madrid when I was given permission by Borussia Dortmund and I love the feeling I got from the club. I couldn’t hide it. I told them straight away what I felt and after that happened on Monday it all happened quickly.”
He also opened up on how he was given the No.5 shirt, which was worn by defender Jesus Vallejo last season, and what it means to him to have Zidane’s old number on his back.
“For a start I’d like to thank Jesus Vallejo for letting me wear the No.5,” he explained.
“I contacted him just to see if it was OK with him and he was just a brilliant guy, he let me wear it and was just so nice about it, so I’m very grateful to him.
“I’ve said in many interviews how much I admire Zidane, the legacy he has at the club and the legacy of his number.
“I’m not trying to be the same as him, I’m just trying to be Jude, but it’s definitely a bit of a homage to how great he was.
“As for the 22, it’s a number that has a lot of meaning to me and in my heart I’m still a 22, I’m just wearing the No.5 on my back.
“We’ll see what happens in the future, but right now I’m really happy to be given this honour of wearing this number.”"
Ryanair sacks chief pilot over sexual misconduct claims,2023-06-15T13:30:00.000000000+00:00,"Reuters
Ryanair has sacked its chief pilot after an investigation into his alleged sexual harassment of female colleagues.
The airline told staff that he had been fired for ""a pattern of repeated inappropriate and unacceptable behaviour towards a number of female pilots"".
The chief pilot, named in reports as Aidan Murray was appointed in 2020 and had been with the airline for 28 years.
Ryanair declined to comment ""on queries relating to individual employees"".
According to The Independent, Mr Murray allegedly harassed nine junior colleagues, including sending text messages to some with comments on their bodies.
Mr Murray, 58, is also accused of altering flight rosters to fly with certain female pilots.
In a note to staff, Ryanair's chief people officer, Darrell Hughes, said Mr Murray's employment had been ""terminated with immediate effect"".
An investigation found his behaviour ""was in breach of our anti-harassment policy"". Ryanair said staff should be able to come to work ""in a safe and secure environment"".
""We would ask all of you to respect the privacy and integrity of those brave individuals who came forward to assist us in this investigation,"" Mr Hughes added.
The Financial Times reported that Mr Murray has seven days to launch an appeal against his dismissal.
The BBC has attempted to contact Mr Murray for comment.
The job of chief pilot is an important one. The holder is both a highly qualified airline captain and a manager, responsible for overseeing other pilots based at a hub airport.
They are usually in charge of issues such as training, flight coordination and rostering as well as addressing personal issues. They can also represent the airline in disciplinary issues.
As such, they have a lot of power over their fellow pilots, particularly more junior ones seeking promotions.
The suggestion that someone in this position might be abusing their power - and behaving in an ""inappropriate and unacceptable"" way towards female staff - is therefore a very serious charge.
It's important to note that we haven't heard the other side of the story. But it appears that whistleblowers have come forward - and have been listened to.
Against that background, the dismissal should come as no surprise.
A report last year by the Royal Aeronautical Society into discrimination and lack of diversity in airline pilot training found ""extremely concerning"" reports of sexism and sexual harassment by many female pilots.
Although many had positive comments on their training, reports of sexism and harassment ranged from ""banter"" to ""uncomfortable advances from male trainers"".

"Vivo X90s Officially Teased, Tipped to Run on New MediaTek Dimensity 9200+ SoC",2023-06-15T13:07:00.000000000+00:00,"Vivo X90s has been teased by Jia Jingdong, Vivo's Vice President and General Manager of Product Strategy via Weibo on Thursday. The new smartphone has a design similar to its Vivo X90 series siblings — Vivo X90 and Vivo X90 Pro. The Vivo X90s is shown to have a Zeiss-tuned triple rear camera unit. The upcoming model is expected to retain the key specification of the Vivo X90. Meanwhile, Chinese tipsters have leaked the specifications of the upcoming handset. The Vivo X90s is said to run on MediaTek Dimensity 9200+ SoC and could be offered in four different colour options.
Jia Jingdong posted an image of the Vivo X90s on the Chinese microblogging platform providing us a glimpse of the design from the rear. The render shows the handset in a white finish with rounded corners. The image suggests Zeiss branded triple rear cameras on the rear panel along with an LED flash. It seems to have a glass back with the Vivo branding at the bottom.
Vivo, however, didn't confirm the exact launch date or key specifications of the Vivo X90s.
Separately, several Chinese tipsters posted specifications of the upcoming Vivo X90s on Weibo. According to the tipsters, the handset will be powered by the latest MediaTek Dimensity 9200+ SoC. This would be an upgrade over the MediaTek Dimensity 9200 SoC found on the vanilla Vivo X90. The new model is said to offer Wi-Fi 7 connectivity and could be offered in black, blue, green, red, and white colour options. The Vivo X90, in contrast, has Wi-Fi 6 and is available in China Red, Ice Blue, and Original Black (translated from Chinese) in China.
A TENAA listing from May revealed the specifications of the Vivo X90s. As per the listing, it will have a 6.78-inch 1.5K (1,280 x 2,800 pixels) curved AMOLED display. The screen has a centre-aligned hole-punch cutout at the top. It is listed to carry up to 16GB of RAM along with up to 1TB of inbuilt storage.
Oppo, OnePlus, Realme to Operate as Separate Entities in India: Report
The triple rear camera setup of the handset could include a 50-megapixel main camera sensor, accompanied by a 12-megapixel ultra-wide lens, and a 12-megapixel portrait sensor. It is said to pack a 32-megapixel selfie camera as well. Vivo is expected to provide a 4,690mAh battery on the Vivo X90s.
The Vivo X90 Pro has finally made its debut in India, but is the company's flagship smartphone for 2023 equipped with enough upgrades over its predecessor?

BofA Surpasses $500 Million in Equity Investments to Support Minority and Women Entrepreneurs,2023-06-15T13:05:00.000000000+00:00,"Investments in Diverse-led Funds Result in Capital Deployed to Over 1,000 Companies Across the U.S.
NEW YORK, June 15, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Bank of America today announced that it has committed more than $500 million in equity investments to minority- and women-led funds, more than doubling its initial $200 million commitment.
The bank has committed equity to more than 150 funds, which to date have invested in over 1,000 companies that span 40 states. These companies are led by 1,500 diverse entrepreneurs and employ over 21,000 people.
""We work across our company to address critical needs in our communities, including the lack of access to capital that diverse business owners face as they start or grow their businesses,"" said Tram Nguyen, Global Head of Strategic and Sustainable Investments at Bank of America. ""We want to empower the talented fund managers who keenly understand how to identify and support those business owners. Each time we support a minority- or women-led fund, they in turn support diverse entrepreneurs, which ultimately helps us toward achieving our goal to advance racial equality and economic opportunity.""
Not only are fund managers breaking down barriers themselves, but they are also investing in companies looking to catalyze change. As a graduate of a Historically Black College and University (HBCU), Nasir Qadree founded Zeal to provide overlooked founders with the resources they need to scale towards their next stage of growth. This includes being an early investor in Esusu, now one of the few Black-owned unicorns, which provides tools to help immigrants and minorities to provide rent reporting and data solutions for credit building.
Chingona Ventures, led by General Partner Samara Hernandez, was the only active fund in the Midwest started and led by a Latina at the time of Bank of America's investment. The fund targets founders with unique backgrounds creating businesses in markets that are often overlooked, like Papaya, a bilingual STEM tutoring organization to close the educational gap for underserved students.
Bank of America continues to innovate and expand the capital and resources entrepreneurs and small business owners of all backgrounds need to help fuel economic growth in their communities. More on Bank of America's work in supporting diverse funds and entrepreneurs can be found here.

UnitedHealth's stock selloff chopped more than 200 points off the Dow's price,2023-06-15T13:02:00.000000000+00:00,"Health insurer's stock suffers second-biggest price decline since it starting trading 39 years ago
Shares of UnitedHealth Group Inc. took a dive Wednesday to suffer their worst percentage performance in three years, after the health insurer said it was facing higher costs from pent-up demand for surgeries.
The stock (UNH) was by far the biggest decliner within the Dow Jones Industrial Average , and was among the worst performers in the S&P 500 , along with fellow health insurers with Medicare Advantage exposure.
UnitedHealth's stock dropped 6.4% to a one-year closing low of $459.86. That was the biggest percentage decline since it sank 7.2% on June 11, 2020.
The stock's price decline of $31.45 was the second-biggest since it started trading in October 1984, behind only the $47.00 (17.3%) plunge on March 16, 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The selloff was cut about 207 points off the Dow's price, as the Dow fell 232.79 points, or 0.7%, while the S&P 500 gained 0.1%.
The selloff comes after Chief Financial Officer John Rex said late Tuesday at a Goldman Sachs investor conference that there were indications of ""pent-up demand"" from senior citizens to have hip and knee procedures and cardiology checkups, which could hurt results from UnitedHealth's Medicare business.
Oppenheimer analyst Michael Wiederhorn said while other insurers that presented at recent conferences didn't mention similar trends, he believed UnitedHealth's comments will weigh on the entire sector.
He said rival Humana Inc. (HUM) was potentially the most exposed, given its larger Medicare Advantage presence. And on cue, Humana's stock was the S&P 500's biggest decliner, tumbling 13.8%.
Some of the S&P 500's other big losers were also in the Medicare Advantage business, as Centene Corp.'s (CNC) stock sank 6.9%, Elevance Health Inc. (ELV) shares shed 6.8% and CVS Health Corp.'s (CVS) stock slid 7.8%.
UnitedHealth's stock has an outsized impact on the Dow's price
UnitedHealth's stock is the highest-priced component of the Dow, which is a price-weighted index, unlike the S&P 500, which is a market-capitalization-weighted index. That means the stock's moves affect the Dow more than any other component.
At Wednesday's closing prices, a 1% move in UnitedHealth's stock represents about a 30-point move in the Dow, while a 1% move in Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.'s (WBA) stock, which is the lowest priced, has about a 2-point effect on the Dow.

Houston Texans Come To Terms With Ex-Third-Round Pick Defensive Tackle,2023-06-15T13:00:00.000000000+00:00,"KEY POINTS
The Texans have signed Maliek Collins to a two-year deal
Collins becomes latest defensive player to settle a contract with a mother team
J.J. Watt has yet to properly file his retirement with the NFL
The Houston Texans have ramped up their defensive needs with the reported signing of Maliek Collins on Wednesday, June 14.
According to Adam Schefter of ESPN, both sides sealed the deal on a contract extension with Collins accepting a $23 million contract extension.
""The deal was negotiated by Texans' GM Nick Caserio and director of football administration Andrew Brown with Collins' agents Drew Rosenhaus and Ryan Matha,"" the scribe wrote on his Twitter post
The new deal gives Collins a bit of a raise and reportedly includes a $20 million guarantee.
In his previous contract, the 28-year-old was earning $17 million with $8.5 million of that guaranteed.
This will be his third year in the NFL, having had previous stops with the Dallas Cowboys (2016-2019) and the Las Vegas Raiders (2020).
The Kansas native had a career-high 37 tackles to go with 3.5 sacks over 15 games last NFL season.
He is projected to be a key piece in the defensive line of the Texans for the next couple of years.
Looking ahead, Collins is expected to fit in nicely with the 4-3 alignment that DeMeco Ryans is expected to implement.
He is likely to become a full-time defensive tackle according to Sam Robison of Pro Football Talk.
With the Texans in rebuilding mode, Collins was seen as one of the bright spots for the team. He started 15 games between 2021 and 2022, combining for six sacks and 18 tackles for a loss.
Now, he will be paid better, which means he will have added responsibility–particularly on the defensive side of the Texans' fence.
The Collins deal also comes not long after other defensive tackles landed new deals with their respective teams. That list includes Dexter Lawrence, Daron Payne, Jeffery Simmons and Ed Oliver.
There are still other names expected to land new contracts this NFL offseason. Yet to come to terms with their teams include Chris Jones of the Kansas City Chiefs and Quinnen Williams of the New York Jets.
In related news, there remain questions in the air on whether J.J. Watt is officially retired.
According to a report by CBS Sports, Watt has yet to fill out his retirement papers with the NFL.
This was despite his retiring last NFL season in an emotional game that saw him record two sacks in his allegedly final NFL game.
Moreover, the five-time first-team All-Pro does not intend to sign a one-day deal with the Texans although this is tied to him being inducted into the club's Ring of Honor.
""I personally just don't really understand or see the reason for it,"" Watt stated. ""It's more just a ceremonial piece of paper. I think that the Ring of Honor and all that comes with it is more than enough."""
NFL Rumors: What Patriots ‘Made Clear’ To DeAndre Hopkins’ Reps,2023-06-15T13:00:00.000000000+00:00,"The Patriots apparently didn’t waste any time courting DeAndre Hopkins once he hit the open market.
Hopkins officially became an NFL free agent when he was released by the Arizona Cardinals on May 26. Around that juncture, New England reportedly reached out to the star wide receiver’s team to express interest. Those conversations birthed a free-agent visit, which reportedly started Wednesday in Foxboro, Mass. and carried into Thursday morning.
“I just got official word: DeAndre Hopkins is in New England,” NFL insider Jeremy Fowler said Thursday on ESPN’s “Get Up.” “He’s meeting with the Patriots. He will meet with the coaches, Bill Belichick. The Patriots’ interest remains high. They made that clear with Hopkins’ representatives from the very beginning when he became a free agent. So, we’ll see if they can close on this thing.”
Hopkins has received co-signs from New England team leaders like Mac Jones and Matthew Judon, and the Patriots reportedly are optimistic they can add the five-time Pro Bowl selection. But even if Hopkins’ meeting with the Patriots goes well, don’t be surprised if the 31-year-old leaves New England without a deal.
“I’m also told Hopkins (is) not in a major rush,” Fowler said. “He’s looking at more of training camp, even early August as more of a harder deadline for him to sign somewhere. So, it would have to be a very sweet offer for New England to make that happen today.”
The Patriots appear to be the second team Hopkins met with as a free agent. Prior to his trip to New England, the veteran pass-catcher talked shop with the Titans in Nashville."

"Gordon McQueen, former Manchester United and Leeds player, dies at 70",2023-06-15T13:00:00.000000000+00:00,"MANCHESTER, England — Gordon McQueen, a defender who played for Manchester United, Leeds and Scotland’s national team, has died. He was 70.
McQueen’s death was announced Thursday via a statement from his family released by Man United.
McQueen was diagnosed with vascular dementia in 2021.
“We hope that as-well as creating many great football memories he’ll be remembered most for his character,” his family said. “Our house was always full of friends, family & football just as it was in his last few months as he fought so bravely in what became a very cruel battle against dementia.
“The disease may have taken him too soon but he definitely lived life to the full, the ultimate entertainer, the absolute heart and soul of every occasion, the most fun dad anyone could wish for.”
McQueen began his career at Scottish club St. Mirren and went on to play in England. He was Britain’s most expensive player when he joined Man United for 495,000 pounds (now $626,000).

He won the English league title with Leeds and the FA Cup with Man United. He also made 30 international appearances for Scotland.
After his playing career, McQueen briefly managed Scottish team Airdrieonians and coached St. Mirren and Middlesbrough.
United said McQueen “oozed command and charisma” at the heart of its defense.
“Everyone at Manchester United is heartbroken by the loss of our beloved former defender, Gordon McQueen,” the club wrote on Twitter. “Our love and condolences are with his family at this terribly sad time.”
Leeds also said it was “saddened” to learn of his passing.
“Gordon was one of the best center backs I had the privilege of playing with,” former Man United teammate Bryan Robson said. “He was a perfect fit for Manchester United with his flair, courage and big personality, and that’s why the fans loved him.
“Most importantly, though, he was a brilliant person with a huge heart. He lit up any room he walked into, and that’s how he should be remembered.”"

“GE Vernova will supply and commission 40 units of its 2.7-132 onshore wind turbines for this 108 MW wind power project. With this order, GE recorded more than 3 GW of orders in India with its 2.7 MW turbine and anticipates crossing 5 GW of onshore wind installed base in the country by early 2024.” the company said.
Amplus Solar’s wind farm will be commissioned by August 2024 and will provide accessible, affordable, and reliable green energy to local businesses and consumers, it added.
Deepak Maloo, Regional Sales Leader for GE Vernova’s onshore wind business in Asia Pacific said, “GE has demonstrated expertise in India, having installed over 50 per cent of new wind capacity in the country last year. We are thankful to Amplus Solar for entrusting us with their first wind farm and look forward to furthering our partnership as the company continues to build its renewable energy portfolio under the leadership of Petronas.”
Amplus Solar CEO, Sharad Pungalia, said, “We are happy to have found an experienced partner GE Vernova as we take another step in contributing to the country’s net-zero targets with our first wind-power project. We are confident that together, we can create the synergies needed for the successful completion of this project.”
GE Vernova’s 2.7-132 wind turbine has proven to be the technology of choice for many customers in India due to its industry leading performance at India’s low wind speeds.
The project will leverage GE’s significant local footprint in India with product design primarily at GE’s technology centre in Bengaluru, turbines assembled at GE’s manufacturing facility in Pune and blades manufactured at LM Wind Power’s plant in Vadodara."

State Street (NYSE:STT) shareholders have endured a 13% loss from investing in the stock five years ago,2023-06-15T12:51:00.000000000+00:00,"In order to justify the effort of selecting individual stocks, it's worth striving to beat the returns from a market index fund. But even the best stock picker will only win with some selections. So we wouldn't blame long term State Street Corporation (NYSE:STT) shareholders for doubting their decision to hold, with the stock down 25% over a half decade. In contrast, the stock price has popped 9.8% in the last thirty days. However, this may be a matter of broader market optimism, since stocks are up 6.8% in the same time.
With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.
View our latest analysis for State Street
To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).
During the unfortunate half decade during which the share price slipped, State Street actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 6.1% per year. So it doesn't seem like EPS is a great guide to understanding how the market is valuing the stock. Alternatively, growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.
Because of the sharp contrast between the EPS growth rate and the share price growth, we're inclined to look to other metrics to understand the changing market sentiment around the stock.
Revenue is actually up 0.5% over the time period. A more detailed examination of the revenue and earnings may or may not explain why the share price languishes; there could be an opportunity.
The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).
State Street is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. You can see what analysts are predicting for State Street in this interactive graph of future profit estimates.
We're pleased to report that State Street shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 22% over one year. That's including the dividend. That certainly beats the loss of about 3% per year over the last half decade. The long term loss makes us cautious, but the short term TSR gain certainly hints at a brighter future.

Paytm FASTag user charged Rs 9 crore for NHAI toll!,2023-06-15T12:44:00.000000000+00:00,"New Delhi: A Paytm FASTag user recently reported that he was charged Rs 9 crore as NHAI toll at Mayar toll plaza near Hisar in Haryana. The user, who goes by profile name ‘gsratta’ on Team-bhp forum, said that he received a text message from Paytm stating that his Fastag has been blacklisted due to insufficient balance. When he checked the Paytm app, he saw that he had been charged Rs 9 crore whereas normal toll at the same toll plaza is Rs90.
“Today I received a text message from Paytm, that the Fastag of my vehicle has been blacklisted, due to insufficient balance, on checking in the Paytm application, I came to know that they had charged a whopping Nine crores ( yes that is true) see the attached screenshots. A popup came up to add ₹ 90000000/- to the Paytm wallet to continue using the fastag. Normal toll at the same toll plaza is ₹90. Contacted the helpline number, but it was not useful. How to proceed now. Please advise,” gsratta wrote on Team-bhp.
The user said that they contacted Paytm customer service, but they were unable to resolve the issue.

“The helpline automated system would not let me talk to a customer care person, instead it required me to raise the issue, in the Help & Support section of the Paytm Application. The result from the same was inconclusive. It doesn’t allow screenshots in the Help & Support section, so had to take pictures using another device,” he added.
Another Team-bhp member ‘Emvi’ meanwhile, shared a screenshot showing he was charged Rs 1.5 crore.
Both Emvi and gsratta, however, later confirmed in the forum that the issues were attributed to technical glitches and were subsequently resolved.
These were not first times for Paytm Fastag users to have been charged an exorbitant amount for toll. In 2022, a user was charged Rs 2 lakh for toll. Paytm had said that the charge was due to a technical error and had rectified the same.
Fastag is a prepaid toll collection system that uses radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. When a vehicle passes through a toll plaza, the RFID tag in the Fastag is read and the toll amount is deducted from the user’s account.
The Fastag system has been praised for its convenience and for reducing traffic congestion at toll plazas. However, the recent incidents have raised concerns about the reliability of the system. The NHAI and Paytm need to take steps to address these concerns and to ensure that the Fastag system is a reliable and convenient way to pay tolls.

Sony SAB launches digital campaign #HameshaKaHiKyun to promote its show ‘Vanshaj’,2023-06-15T12:44:00.000000000+00:00,"Sony SAB has launched a digital campaign #HameshaKaHiKyun for its new show ‘Vanshaj’. The campaign highlights the fact that only 15% of board members in Indian family businesses are women, and the percentage of women holding senior VP roles has decreased from 18% to 13%. The campaign aims to challenge gender stereotypes and advocate for inclusivity in leadership roles.
Sony SAB’s new family drama, ‘Vanshaj’ delves into the dynamics of a legacy business empire, challenging conventional patriarchal narratives. ‘Vanshaj’ aims to shatter the glass ceiling and emphasize that leadership and entrepreneurship should be determined by one’s abilities rather than gender.
“Sony SAB as a brand believes in real stories and real emotions, exploring new and more relevant themes that resonate with the lives of our viewers more closely. Vanshaj is one more forward-looking show from the channel which explores the challenges regarding inheritance even in today’s world. Using a sharp consumer insight helped us come up with a strong consumer campaign both for mass media and digital, riding on the understanding that most family-owned businesses often choose a male heir to take over the reins,” Vaishali Sharma, head of marketing, Sony SAB, said.
Since its launch, the campaign has gained traction by showcasing the lack of female representation in corporate leadership roles through a series of impactful videos. The success of the campaign reflects the growing desire for change and the need to amplify the voices of women leaders."

JetBlue introduces a new and blue standard livery: video,2023-06-15T12:35:49.000000000+00:00,"JetBlue has introduced a new standard livery for its aircraft, replacing the white-focused fuselages with an all-blue design.
The New York John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK)-based carrier revealed the new livery in a Twitter video, calling the new design a livery that got “a fresh bold look just like the moves we’ve been making as a travel company”.
In a separate press release, the airline explained that it has always “made big bold moves – and we’re matching those with a big bold update to our iconic liveries, with a blue allover fuselage, refreshed (and refreshing) accent colors, energized tailfin patterns that extend onto the body and belly, and more”.
According to JetBlue, the first aircraft to bear the new livery will be named “A Defining MoMint”. The Airbus A321, registered as N982JB, was delivered to the airline new in August 2017. Flightradar24.com data showed that the A321 was at Macon Middle Georgia Regional Airport (MCN), Georgia, United States (US) between May 29 and June 14, 2023, when it flew back to JFK.
Since then, the aircraft operated a round-trip itinerary to San Francisco International Airport (SFO), with another round-trip journey planned to SFO on June 15, 2023. Following the flight to SFO, however, the Airbus A321 is scheduled to fly to Las Vegas Harry Reid International Airport (LAS).
“Look for refreshed versions of our existing patterns to make their runway debuts as the rest of the fleet is repaint-ready,” concluded JetBlue.
Defining MoMint is equipped with 16 Mint suites, a “refreshing take on premium travel, plus a Core experience that’s tech-forward and trek-friendly, and a fully-stocked grab-and-go Pantry,” as described by the airline.
Previously, the aircraft was known as “One Mint, Two Mint, Blue Mint, You Mint”.
In total, JetBlue has 34 Airbus A321s equipped with Mint Suites, while another 28 A321s are configured in an all-economy 200-seat configuration."

Premier League debutants Luton will play their first top-flight fixture since 1992 away to Roberto De Zerbi’s Brighton on Saturday, August 12, having to wait until the following weekend for their first home game when Kenilworth Road will become the smallest ground to host a fixture in the competition for the visit of Burnley.
The other promoted side Sheffield United kick off their season with a home game against Crystal Palace.
The outstanding fixture of the opening weekend will be at Stamford Bridge where Mauricio Pochettino begins life as Chelsea manager against Liverpool on Sunday, August 13, with both sides looking to bounce back after disappointing campaigns.

Ex-Flipkart senior executive Goteti starts up again with travel fintech Scapia,2023-06-15T12:31:00.000000000+00:00,"Flipkart veteran Anil Goteti has embarked on a fintech venture. Scapia, which features a credit card and an app, allows customers to earn points earned on card spends to be redeemed for flights and hotel stays worldwide.
The card, introduced in partnership with Federal Bank and based on the VISA network, can be used in over 150 countries across a million merchants, enabling users to access transactions in real-time within the Scapia app.
“Scapia aims to rewrite the narrative by offering 10% rewards on every transaction, minting these rewards into Scapia coins,” the company said in a statement. “These coins then become your ticket to the world, redeemable for flights and hotel stays across the globe, with a user-friendly, one-click redemption on the Scapia app.”
The card also offers travel benefits like zero forex markup, unlimited domestic lounge access with zero joining and annual fees.
“Scapia is more than a credit card. It's a commitment to making travel accessible for everyone who dreams of seeing the world. It's a new way to reward young Indian travellers,” Goteti, who was earlier a senior vice president at Flipkart, said.
Scapia, which has been in stealth mode for over a year, is Goteti’s second independent foray in the startup space. ET in January 2022 reported that Goteti’s earlier venture, Protonn, shut its business and returned over $9 million to investors, which included the likes of Matrix Partners and Flipkart cofounder Binny Bansal.
Goteti, who headed some of Flipkart’s key businesses such as mobile, home and furniture categories, quit the e-commerce firm in November 2020 after an eight-year stint and set up Protonn the following year. The company, however, could not find the right product-market fit and the founders did not agree to pivot its business model.

Manchester United competing with Chelsea for Inter’s André Onana,2023-06-15T12:29:46.000000000+00:00,"Chelsea face competition from Manchester United for the signing of the Internazionale goalkeeper André Onana. United have also shortlisted Porto’s Diogo Costa as they target a challenger to David de Gea.
De Gea is out of contract this summer and yet to finalise a new deal. The Spaniard has been one of United’s best players since joining in 2011 but was inconsistent last season and Erik ten Hag wants to bring in a goalkeeper.
United are weighing up their next move after becoming discouraged in their pursuit of Tottenham’s Harry Kane. Signing a top striker is a priority for Ten Hag but Spurs do not want to sell Kane and Napoli’s asking price for Victor Osimhen is prohibitive. Atalanta’s Rasmus Højlund is a target, but the Dane is one for the future.
United must also decide whether to improve their offer for the Chelsea midfielder Mason Mount, after having an opening bid of £40m turned down. They could decide to spend heavily on a goalkeeper if they cannot sign a world-class No 9.
De Gea was at fault for Manchester City’s winner in the FA Cup final and his unconvincing distribution has raised doubts over whether the 32-year-old is suited to Ten Hag’s football. Chelsea and United have registered an interest in Onana with Inter, whose financial problems could force them to sell. It is believed the Cameroon international would favour a move to United. Costa is an alternative target for Ten Hag. The 23-year-old is highly rated and a Portugal international.
Onana is excellent with the ball at his feet and impressed during Inter’s run to the Champions League final, where they were beaten 1-0 by Manchester City. Inter fear they will lose Onana and have inquired about Brentford’s David Raya, who is wanted by Tottenham.
Signing Onana would fix a problem area for Chelsea, who will listen to offers for Kepa Arrizabalaga and Édouard Mendy. Arrizabalaga’s high wages could make him harder to sell than Mendy, who lost his place to the Spaniard last season. Chelsea have also targeted Milan’s Mike Maignan and Valencia’s Giorgi Mamardashvili.
Chelsea have held talks with Inter over a number of issues this week. Along with discussing Onana, Inter have explored signing Kalidou Koulibaly and Romelu Lukaku on loan. Chelsea need to raise funds and would prefer to sell Koulibaly and Lukaku.
Chelsea want £70m plus add-ons for Mount. They are expected to sell Mateo Kovacic to Manchester City and want £70m for Kai Havertz, who is a target for Arsenal."

Coinbase Announces Repurchase of 0.50% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2026,2023-06-15T12:20:00.000000000+00:00,"Coinbase Announces Repurchase of 0.50% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2026
Repurchasing $64.5 million of convertible senior notes at approximately 29% discount to par value
On June 14, 2023, Coinbase Global, Inc. (the “Company” or “Coinbase”) entered into separate, privately negotiated purchase agreements with a limited number of holders of its 0.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the “Notes”) to repurchase (the “Repurchases”) $64.5 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes. The Company estimates that it will expend approximately $45.5 million in cash to consummate the Repurchases. The transaction represents an approximately 29% discount to par value.
The Company previously entered into capped call transactions with certain financial institutions in connection with the initial issuance of the Notes. All of these transactions are expected to remain in effect notwithstanding the Repurchases.
The Repurchases are expected to close on or about June 20, 2023, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Following such closings, approximately $1.373 billion principal amount of the Notes will remain outstanding.
“We are always looking for the best opportunities to deploy capital to create shareholder value,” said Alesia Haas, Chief Financial Officer of Coinbase. “As we stated in our most recent shareholder letter, the first quarter of 2023 was a turning point in building a company that is more efficient and financially disciplined. This opportunistic repurchase is a continuation of those efforts and reflects our confidence in our business, strong first quarter financial performance, and improved competitive positioning. We have reduced our 2026 convertible senior notes outstanding and we will look for additional such opportunities in the future.”

"Uber Closes Delivery Business in Italy, Mobility Business in Israel",2023-06-15T12:19:00.000000000+00:00,"Uber Technologies is discontinuing its Uber Eats delivery business in Italy as well as its eponymous mobility business in Israel as Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi seeks to focus on markets where the group can be the first or second largest player.

UPDATE 2-Delta Air Lines resumes dividend suspended in 2020 during pandemic,2023-06-15T12:15:00.000000000+00:00,"(Adds Southwest action, more detail on Delta dividend)
June 15 (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines said on Thursday it would pay a quarterly dividend, resuming a payout that the carrier had suspended in March 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The dividend, of $0.10 per share, will be paid on Aug. 7 to shareholders of record as of the close of business July 17, the U.S. airline said.
In December, Southwest Airlines became the first major U.S. airline to reinstate its quarterly dividend, more than two years after suspending it in the wake of the pandemic.
The resumption of Delta's payout reflects its progress on its three-year financial plan, the airline said, including more than $10 billion of debt repayment over the last two years.
The move comes as Delta forecast that strong summer travel demand will result in higher-than-expected profit for the quarter through June.
As a condition of receiving $54 billion government assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic, airlines were prohibited from paying dividends or repurchasing stock.
Those restrictions expired last fall. Delta Air Lines received $11.9 billion in U.S. assistance.
In March 2020, Delta paid a $0.4025 share dividend, which was its 27th consecutive dividend at the time. (Reporting by Aishwarya Nair in Bengaluru and David Shepardson in Washington; Editing by Savio D'Souza and Alexander Smith)"

Real Madrid or Inter could give Man City fixture nightmare in Premier League and Champions League,2023-06-15T12:14:00.000000000+00:00,"Manchester City's fixture list for 2023/24 has thrown up plenty of nuances, with extremely difficult runs of games in October and March.
From October, City face Arsenal, Brighton, Manchester United, Chelsea, Liverpool and Tottenham in the space of seven Premier League fixtures, and the same group of games are reversed in the Spring.
In March, City will play United, Liverpool, Brighton and Arsenal all in a row, and around key Champions League fixtures to make the task even more difficult.
With six Champions League group games before Christmas, the fixture computer has thrown up some potentially difficult weeks where City are in European action either side of games that could turn out to be crucial in the league.
ALSO READ: Pep Guardiola's most feared fixture will come at the worst time for Man City treble defence
The Champions League group stage kicks off on September 19/20, in between a trip to West Ham and a home fixture with Nottingham Forest.
The second matchday of the group stage comes on October 3 or 4 after a trip to Wolves and before an eagerly-anticipated clash with Arsenal at the Etihad.
Later in October, City host Brighton, then play their next Champions League fixture on October 24 or 25, before travelling to Manchester United for the first derby of the season.
The matchday four fixtures are on November 7 or 8, and come in between a home clash with Bournemouth and a potentially tricky trip to Chelsea.
After the November international break, City welcome Liverpool in the Premier League, face a crucial matchday five on November 28 or 29 in Europe, and then host Tottenham immediately afterwards.
The final matchday - where City will hope to have secured qualification - comes between a first trip to Kenilworth Road to take on Luton, and a home meeting with Crystal Palace.
City are guaranteed a place in Pot One in the Champions League after winning the competition but could face Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid, Inter Milan, Borussia Dortmund, RB Leipzig or Porto from Pot Two. Selected other teams across Pots Three and Four include AC Milan, Real Sociedad and Celtic.
That means City could face a run of fixtures like Liverpool at home, Real Madrid away, and Tottenham at home - or Brighton at home, Inter Milan away, and Manchester United away.
Assuming City qualify for the last-16, the first leg could take place on one of two midweeks in February. Either it could be played in between Premier League home fixtures against Everton and Chelsea, or it could be played between the Chelsea game and a trip to Bournemouth.
The second leg will be played in the middle of a difficult March fixture list, either between United at home and Liverpool away, or between Liverpool away and Brighton away.
Should City progress to the quarter-finals, the first leg will come after the trip to Crystal Palace and before the visit of Luton. The second leg, a week later, will be played before the ever-difficult trip to Tottenham. However, should City or Spurs reach the FA Cup semi-finals, that would likely cause the Premier League game to be rearranged.
On to the potential semi-finals, and City face Nottingham Forest away before the first legs on April 30 or May 1. Then Wolves visit City at the weekend, before the second leg on May 7 or 8, and then a tricky trip to Fulham.
