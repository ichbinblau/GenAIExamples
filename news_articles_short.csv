Dáil almost suspended after Sinn Féin TD put pager in front of Minister during firefighters debate,2023-06-15T14:32:11.000000000+00:00,"The Dáil was almost suspended on Thursday afternoon after Sinn Féin TD John Brady walked across the chamber and placed an on-call pager in front of the Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien during a debate on retained firefighters.
Mr O’Brien said Mr Brady had taken part in “an act of theatre” that was “obviously choreographed”.
Around 2,000 retained firefighters around the country staged a second day of industrial action on Tuesday and are due to start all out-strike action from next Tuesday. The mostly part-time workers, who keep the services going outside of Ireland’s larger urban centres, are taking industrial action in a dispute over pay and working conditions.
Speaking in the Dáil, Sinn Féin deputy leader Pearse Doherty said firefighters had marched on Leinster House today and were “very angry” at “the fact the Government will not intervene”.

“An intervention is required now. I’m asking you to make an improved offer in relation to pay for retained firefighters,” Mr Doherty told the housing minister.
“I’m also asking you, and challenging you, to go outside after this Order of Business and meet with the firefighters because they are just fed up to the hilt in relation to what you said.
“Some of them have handed in their pagers to members of the Opposition and have challenged you to wear the pager for the next number of weeks, put up with an €8,600 retainer and not leave your community for the two and a half kilometres and see how you can stand over those type of pay and conditions.”
At this point, Mr Brady got up from his seat, walked across the chamber and placed the pager on the desk in front of Mr O’Brien. Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl said the Sinn Féin TD was “completely out of order” and told him not to “carry out a charade in this House”, adding it was “absolutely outrageous behaviour and not to be encouraged”.
Mr O’Brien said Mr Brady had engaged in “an act of theatre here today which was obviously choreographed” and was then interrupted with shouts from the Opposition benches. Mr Ó Fearghaíl said he would suspend the House “if this racket continues”.
Mr O’Brien later said he said he was confident the dispute could be resolved and he had “immense regard” for firefighters. The minister said he would encourage the unions to re-engage with the State’s industrial relations process while also accusing Sinn Féin of using the issue for their “own political gain”.
“You see what happened here today, you’re shameless and people see through it,” he told Mr Doherty."
Epic’s latest tool can animate hyperrealistic MetaHumans with an iPhone,2023-06-15T14:00:00.000000000+00:00,"Today, Epic is releasing a new tool designed to capture an actor’s facial performance using a device as simple as an iPhone and apply it to a hyperrealistic “MetaHuman” in the Unreal Engine in “minutes.” The feature, dubbed MetaHuman Animator, was detailed at the Game Developers Conference in March but is now available for developers to try out for themselves. Epic has also released a new video today produced by one of its internal teams to show what the tool is capable of.
While Epic’s short film shows off some impressively subtle facial animation, the big benefit the company is emphasizing is the speed with which MetaHuman Animator produces results. “The animation is produced locally using GPU hardware, with the final animation available in minutes,” the company’s press release reads. That has the potential to not just save a studio money by making performance capture more efficient but also, Epic argues, it could allow them to experiment and be more creative.
“Need an actor to give you more, dig into a different emotion, or simply explore a new direction?” Epic’s press release asks. “Have them do another take. You’ll be able to review the results in about the time it takes to make a cup of coffee.” Facial animation can be applied to a MetaHuman character “in just a few clicks,” Epic says, and the system is even smart enough to animate a character’s tongue based on the performance’s audio.
Performance capture using iPhones has been possible in the Unreal Engine since at least 2020 with the launch of Epic’s Live Link Face iOS app, but now, it’s combined with the high level of detail promised by Epic’s MetaHuman technology. As well as working on the iPhone 12 and up (which is capable of capturing both video and depth data), Epic says MetaHuman Animator can also be used with “existing vertical stereo head-mounted camera [systems] to achieve even greater fidelity.”
Epic says the Blue Dot short film released today should give some idea of what its animation tool is capable of. It was produced by Epic Games’ 3Lateral team and stars actor Radivoje Bukvić delivering a monologue based on a poem by Mika Antić. Although Epic says it’s possible to tweak animation post-capture, it claims “minimal interventions” were made on top of the MetaHuman Animator’s performance capture to achieve these results.
If you want to learn more, Epic has released an instructional video on how to use the tool. Documentation is also available via the MetaHuman hub on the Epic Developer Community."
"EU to Ban Huawei, ZTE from Internal Commission Networks",2023-06-15T13:50:00.000000000+00:00,"The European Commission is planning to ban equipment from Chinese vendors Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp. from its own internal telecommunications networks, people familiar with the matter said.
The ban comes ahead of an anticipated update to the European Union’s guidance on 5G mobile networks within the bloc that’s expected to more forcefully encourage members to phase out equipment from the companies, which it considers high risk, the people said, asking not to be identified because the plan isn’t yet public.
As the relationship between the US and its allies and China has deteriorated, countries have blocked Chinese technology from their core telecommunications networks because of spying concerns. The move is similar to the commission’s decision to block its staff from using TikTok Inc. over security concerns related to the social-media app’s data-collection practices.
Read More: TikTok Banned From EU Commission Phones Amid Security Fears
In the EU’s review of the 5G “toolbox,” the commission will say that publicly excluding Huawei and ZTE from national networks is justified and will explicitly call out Huawei and ZTE as high-risk vendors by name for the first time. The majority of countries have yet to ban the two Chinese vendors from their networks.
Representatives for Huawei and ZTE didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

"Arsenal have Rice bid rejected, new Premier League fixtures released, Man United out of Harry Kane race, Chelsea reject Mason Mount bid",2023-06-15T13:31:42.000000000+00:00,"Jude Bellingham has also insisted his move to Real Madrid had nothing to do with money, as he explained how his transfer was wrapped up so quickly.
“Money is not a thing for me,” he said.
“I dont think about money at all when I make these kinds of decisions. I never have and I never will. I play the game purely out of love.
“I spoke with people from Real Madrid when I was given permission by Borussia Dortmund and I love the feeling I got from the club. I couldn’t hide it. I told them straight away what I felt and after that happened on Monday it all happened quickly.”
He also opened up on how he was given the No.5 shirt, which was worn by defender Jesus Vallejo last season, and what it means to him to have Zidane’s old number on his back.
“For a start I’d like to thank Jesus Vallejo for letting me wear the No.5,” he explained.
“I contacted him just to see if it was OK with him and he was just a brilliant guy, he let me wear it and was just so nice about it, so I’m very grateful to him.
“I’ve said in many interviews how much I admire Zidane, the legacy he has at the club and the legacy of his number.
“I’m not trying to be the same as him, I’m just trying to be Jude, but it’s definitely a bit of a homage to how great he was.
“As for the 22, it’s a number that has a lot of meaning to me and in my heart I’m still a 22, I’m just wearing the No.5 on my back.
“We’ll see what happens in the future, but right now I’m really happy to be given this honour of wearing this number.”"
Ryanair sacks chief pilot over sexual misconduct claims,2023-06-15T13:30:00.000000000+00:00,"Reuters
Ryanair has sacked its chief pilot after an investigation into his alleged sexual harassment of female colleagues.
The airline told staff that he had been fired for ""a pattern of repeated inappropriate and unacceptable behaviour towards a number of female pilots"".
The chief pilot, named in reports as Aidan Murray was appointed in 2020 and had been with the airline for 28 years.
Ryanair declined to comment ""on queries relating to individual employees"".
According to The Independent, Mr Murray allegedly harassed nine junior colleagues, including sending text messages to some with comments on their bodies.
Mr Murray, 58, is also accused of altering flight rosters to fly with certain female pilots.
In a note to staff, Ryanair's chief people officer, Darrell Hughes, said Mr Murray's employment had been ""terminated with immediate effect"".
An investigation found his behaviour ""was in breach of our anti-harassment policy"". Ryanair said staff should be able to come to work ""in a safe and secure environment"".
""We would ask all of you to respect the privacy and integrity of those brave individuals who came forward to assist us in this investigation,"" Mr Hughes added.
The Financial Times reported that Mr Murray has seven days to launch an appeal against his dismissal.
The BBC has attempted to contact Mr Murray for comment.
The job of chief pilot is an important one. The holder is both a highly qualified airline captain and a manager, responsible for overseeing other pilots based at a hub airport.
They are usually in charge of issues such as training, flight coordination and rostering as well as addressing personal issues. They can also represent the airline in disciplinary issues.
As such, they have a lot of power over their fellow pilots, particularly more junior ones seeking promotions.
The suggestion that someone in this position might be abusing their power - and behaving in an ""inappropriate and unacceptable"" way towards female staff - is therefore a very serious charge.
It's important to note that we haven't heard the other side of the story. But it appears that whistleblowers have come forward - and have been listened to.
Against that background, the dismissal should come as no surprise.
A report last year by the Royal Aeronautical Society into discrimination and lack of diversity in airline pilot training found ""extremely concerning"" reports of sexism and sexual harassment by many female pilots.
Although many had positive comments on their training, reports of sexism and harassment ranged from ""banter"" to ""uncomfortable advances from male trainers"".

"Vivo X90s Officially Teased, Tipped to Run on New MediaTek Dimensity 9200+ SoC",2023-06-15T13:07:00.000000000+00:00,"Vivo X90s has been teased by Jia Jingdong, Vivo's Vice President and General Manager of Product Strategy via Weibo on Thursday. The new smartphone has a design similar to its Vivo X90 series siblings — Vivo X90 and Vivo X90 Pro. The Vivo X90s is shown to have a Zeiss-tuned triple rear camera unit. The upcoming model is expected to retain the key specification of the Vivo X90. Meanwhile, Chinese tipsters have leaked the specifications of the upcoming handset. The Vivo X90s is said to run on MediaTek Dimensity 9200+ SoC and could be offered in four different colour options.
Jia Jingdong posted an image of the Vivo X90s on the Chinese microblogging platform providing us a glimpse of the design from the rear. The render shows the handset in a white finish with rounded corners. The image suggests Zeiss branded triple rear cameras on the rear panel along with an LED flash. It seems to have a glass back with the Vivo branding at the bottom.
Vivo, however, didn't confirm the exact launch date or key specifications of the Vivo X90s.
Separately, several Chinese tipsters posted specifications of the upcoming Vivo X90s on Weibo. According to the tipsters, the handset will be powered by the latest MediaTek Dimensity 9200+ SoC. This would be an upgrade over the MediaTek Dimensity 9200 SoC found on the vanilla Vivo X90. The new model is said to offer Wi-Fi 7 connectivity and could be offered in black, blue, green, red, and white colour options. The Vivo X90, in contrast, has Wi-Fi 6 and is available in China Red, Ice Blue, and Original Black (translated from Chinese) in China.
A TENAA listing from May revealed the specifications of the Vivo X90s. As per the listing, it will have a 6.78-inch 1.5K (1,280 x 2,800 pixels) curved AMOLED display. The screen has a centre-aligned hole-punch cutout at the top. It is listed to carry up to 16GB of RAM along with up to 1TB of inbuilt storage.
Oppo, OnePlus, Realme to Operate as Separate Entities in India: Report
The triple rear camera setup of the handset could include a 50-megapixel main camera sensor, accompanied by a 12-megapixel ultra-wide lens, and a 12-megapixel portrait sensor. It is said to pack a 32-megapixel selfie camera as well. Vivo is expected to provide a 4,690mAh battery on the Vivo X90s.
The Vivo X90 Pro has finally made its debut in India, but is the company's flagship smartphone for 2023 equipped with enough upgrades over its predecessor?

BofA Surpasses $500 Million in Equity Investments to Support Minority and Women Entrepreneurs,2023-06-15T13:05:00.000000000+00:00,"Investments in Diverse-led Funds Result in Capital Deployed to Over 1,000 Companies Across the U.S.
NEW YORK, June 15, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Bank of America today announced that it has committed more than $500 million in equity investments to minority- and women-led funds, more than doubling its initial $200 million commitment.
The bank has committed equity to more than 150 funds, which to date have invested in over 1,000 companies that span 40 states. These companies are led by 1,500 diverse entrepreneurs and employ over 21,000 people.
""We work across our company to address critical needs in our communities, including the lack of access to capital that diverse business owners face as they start or grow their businesses,"" said Tram Nguyen, Global Head of Strategic and Sustainable Investments at Bank of America. ""We want to empower the talented fund managers who keenly understand how to identify and support those business owners. Each time we support a minority- or women-led fund, they in turn support diverse entrepreneurs, which ultimately helps us toward achieving our goal to advance racial equality and economic opportunity.""
Not only are fund managers breaking down barriers themselves, but they are also investing in companies looking to catalyze change. As a graduate of a Historically Black College and University (HBCU), Nasir Qadree founded Zeal to provide overlooked founders with the resources they need to scale towards their next stage of growth. This includes being an early investor in Esusu, now one of the few Black-owned unicorns, which provides tools to help immigrants and minorities to provide rent reporting and data solutions for credit building.
Chingona Ventures, led by General Partner Samara Hernandez, was the only active fund in the Midwest started and led by a Latina at the time of Bank of America's investment. The fund targets founders with unique backgrounds creating businesses in markets that are often overlooked, like Papaya, a bilingual STEM tutoring organization to close the educational gap for underserved students.
Bank of America continues to innovate and expand the capital and resources entrepreneurs and small business owners of all backgrounds need to help fuel economic growth in their communities. More on Bank of America's work in supporting diverse funds and entrepreneurs can be found here.

UnitedHealth's stock selloff chopped more than 200 points off the Dow's price,2023-06-15T13:02:00.000000000+00:00,"Health insurer's stock suffers second-biggest price decline since it starting trading 39 years ago
Shares of UnitedHealth Group Inc. took a dive Wednesday to suffer their worst percentage performance in three years, after the health insurer said it was facing higher costs from pent-up demand for surgeries.
The stock (UNH) was by far the biggest decliner within the Dow Jones Industrial Average , and was among the worst performers in the S&P 500 , along with fellow health insurers with Medicare Advantage exposure.
UnitedHealth's stock dropped 6.4% to a one-year closing low of $459.86. That was the biggest percentage decline since it sank 7.2% on June 11, 2020.
The stock's price decline of $31.45 was the second-biggest since it started trading in October 1984, behind only the $47.00 (17.3%) plunge on March 16, 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The selloff was cut about 207 points off the Dow's price, as the Dow fell 232.79 points, or 0.7%, while the S&P 500 gained 0.1%.
The selloff comes after Chief Financial Officer John Rex said late Tuesday at a Goldman Sachs investor conference that there were indications of ""pent-up demand"" from senior citizens to have hip and knee procedures and cardiology checkups, which could hurt results from UnitedHealth's Medicare business.
Oppenheimer analyst Michael Wiederhorn said while other insurers that presented at recent conferences didn't mention similar trends, he believed UnitedHealth's comments will weigh on the entire sector.
He said rival Humana Inc. (HUM) was potentially the most exposed, given its larger Medicare Advantage presence. And on cue, Humana's stock was the S&P 500's biggest decliner, tumbling 13.8%.
Some of the S&P 500's other big losers were also in the Medicare Advantage business, as Centene Corp.'s (CNC) stock sank 6.9%, Elevance Health Inc. (ELV) shares shed 6.8% and CVS Health Corp.'s (CVS) stock slid 7.8%.
UnitedHealth's stock has an outsized impact on the Dow's price
UnitedHealth's stock is the highest-priced component of the Dow, which is a price-weighted index, unlike the S&P 500, which is a market-capitalization-weighted index. That means the stock's moves affect the Dow more than any other component.
At Wednesday's closing prices, a 1% move in UnitedHealth's stock represents about a 30-point move in the Dow, while a 1% move in Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.'s (WBA) stock, which is the lowest priced, has about a 2-point effect on the Dow.

Houston Texans Come To Terms With Ex-Third-Round Pick Defensive Tackle,2023-06-15T13:00:00.000000000+00:00,"KEY POINTS
The Texans have signed Maliek Collins to a two-year deal
Collins becomes latest defensive player to settle a contract with a mother team
J.J. Watt has yet to properly file his retirement with the NFL
The Houston Texans have ramped up their defensive needs with the reported signing of Maliek Collins on Wednesday, June 14.
According to Adam Schefter of ESPN, both sides sealed the deal on a contract extension with Collins accepting a $23 million contract extension.
""The deal was negotiated by Texans' GM Nick Caserio and director of football administration Andrew Brown with Collins' agents Drew Rosenhaus and Ryan Matha,"" the scribe wrote on his Twitter post
The new deal gives Collins a bit of a raise and reportedly includes a $20 million guarantee.
In his previous contract, the 28-year-old was earning $17 million with $8.5 million of that guaranteed.
This will be his third year in the NFL, having had previous stops with the Dallas Cowboys (2016-2019) and the Las Vegas Raiders (2020).
The Kansas native had a career-high 37 tackles to go with 3.5 sacks over 15 games last NFL season.
He is projected to be a key piece in the defensive line of the Texans for the next couple of years.
Looking ahead, Collins is expected to fit in nicely with the 4-3 alignment that DeMeco Ryans is expected to implement.
He is likely to become a full-time defensive tackle according to Sam Robison of Pro Football Talk.
With the Texans in rebuilding mode, Collins was seen as one of the bright spots for the team. He started 15 games between 2021 and 2022, combining for six sacks and 18 tackles for a loss.
Now, he will be paid better, which means he will have added responsibility–particularly on the defensive side of the Texans' fence.
The Collins deal also comes not long after other defensive tackles landed new deals with their respective teams. That list includes Dexter Lawrence, Daron Payne, Jeffery Simmons and Ed Oliver.
There are still other names expected to land new contracts this NFL offseason. Yet to come to terms with their teams include Chris Jones of the Kansas City Chiefs and Quinnen Williams of the New York Jets.
In related news, there remain questions in the air on whether J.J. Watt is officially retired.
According to a report by CBS Sports, Watt has yet to fill out his retirement papers with the NFL.
This was despite his retiring last NFL season in an emotional game that saw him record two sacks in his allegedly final NFL game.
Moreover, the five-time first-team All-Pro does not intend to sign a one-day deal with the Texans although this is tied to him being inducted into the club's Ring of Honor.
""I personally just don't really understand or see the reason for it,"" Watt stated. ""It's more just a ceremonial piece of paper. I think that the Ring of Honor and all that comes with it is more than enough."""
NFL Rumors: What Patriots ‘Made Clear’ To DeAndre Hopkins’ Reps,2023-06-15T13:00:00.000000000+00:00,"The Patriots apparently didn’t waste any time courting DeAndre Hopkins once he hit the open market.
Hopkins officially became an NFL free agent when he was released by the Arizona Cardinals on May 26. Around that juncture, New England reportedly reached out to the star wide receiver’s team to express interest. Those conversations birthed a free-agent visit, which reportedly started Wednesday in Foxboro, Mass. and carried into Thursday morning.
“I just got official word: DeAndre Hopkins is in New England,” NFL insider Jeremy Fowler said Thursday on ESPN’s “Get Up.” “He’s meeting with the Patriots. He will meet with the coaches, Bill Belichick. The Patriots’ interest remains high. They made that clear with Hopkins’ representatives from the very beginning when he became a free agent. So, we’ll see if they can close on this thing.”
Hopkins has received co-signs from New England team leaders like Mac Jones and Matthew Judon, and the Patriots reportedly are optimistic they can add the five-time Pro Bowl selection. But even if Hopkins’ meeting with the Patriots goes well, don’t be surprised if the 31-year-old leaves New England without a deal.
“I’m also told Hopkins (is) not in a major rush,” Fowler said. “He’s looking at more of training camp, even early August as more of a harder deadline for him to sign somewhere. So, it would have to be a very sweet offer for New England to make that happen today.”
The Patriots appear to be the second team Hopkins met with as a free agent. Prior to his trip to New England, the veteran pass-catcher talked shop with the Titans in Nashville."

"Gordon McQueen, former Manchester United and Leeds player, dies at 70",2023-06-15T13:00:00.000000000+00:00,"MANCHESTER, England — Gordon McQueen, a defender who played for Manchester United, Leeds and Scotland’s national team, has died. He was 70.
McQueen’s death was announced Thursday via a statement from his family released by Man United.
McQueen was diagnosed with vascular dementia in 2021.
“We hope that as-well as creating many great football memories he’ll be remembered most for his character,” his family said. “Our house was always full of friends, family & football just as it was in his last few months as he fought so bravely in what became a very cruel battle against dementia.
“The disease may have taken him too soon but he definitely lived life to the full, the ultimate entertainer, the absolute heart and soul of every occasion, the most fun dad anyone could wish for.”
McQueen began his career at Scottish club St. Mirren and went on to play in England. He was Britain’s most expensive player when he joined Man United for 495,000 pounds (now $626,000).

He won the English league title with Leeds and the FA Cup with Man United. He also made 30 international appearances for Scotland.
After his playing career, McQueen briefly managed Scottish team Airdrieonians and coached St. Mirren and Middlesbrough.
United said McQueen “oozed command and charisma” at the heart of its defense.
“Everyone at Manchester United is heartbroken by the loss of our beloved former defender, Gordon McQueen,” the club wrote on Twitter. “Our love and condolences are with his family at this terribly sad time.”
Leeds also said it was “saddened” to learn of his passing.
“Gordon was one of the best center backs I had the privilege of playing with,” former Man United teammate Bryan Robson said. “He was a perfect fit for Manchester United with his flair, courage and big personality, and that’s why the fans loved him.
“Most importantly, though, he was a brilliant person with a huge heart. He lit up any room he walked into, and that’s how he should be remembered.”"

“GE Vernova will supply and commission 40 units of its 2.7-132 onshore wind turbines for this 108 MW wind power project. With this order, GE recorded more than 3 GW of orders in India with its 2.7 MW turbine and anticipates crossing 5 GW of onshore wind installed base in the country by early 2024.” the company said.
Amplus Solar’s wind farm will be commissioned by August 2024 and will provide accessible, affordable, and reliable green energy to local businesses and consumers, it added.
Deepak Maloo, Regional Sales Leader for GE Vernova’s onshore wind business in Asia Pacific said, “GE has demonstrated expertise in India, having installed over 50 per cent of new wind capacity in the country last year. We are thankful to Amplus Solar for entrusting us with their first wind farm and look forward to furthering our partnership as the company continues to build its renewable energy portfolio under the leadership of Petronas.”
Amplus Solar CEO, Sharad Pungalia, said, “We are happy to have found an experienced partner GE Vernova as we take another step in contributing to the country’s net-zero targets with our first wind-power project. We are confident that together, we can create the synergies needed for the successful completion of this project.”
GE Vernova’s 2.7-132 wind turbine has proven to be the technology of choice for many customers in India due to its industry leading performance at India’s low wind speeds.
The project will leverage GE’s significant local footprint in India with product design primarily at GE’s technology centre in Bengaluru, turbines assembled at GE’s manufacturing facility in Pune and blades manufactured at LM Wind Power’s plant in Vadodara."

State Street (NYSE:STT) shareholders have endured a 13% loss from investing in the stock five years ago,2023-06-15T12:51:00.000000000+00:00,"In order to justify the effort of selecting individual stocks, it's worth striving to beat the returns from a market index fund. But even the best stock picker will only win with some selections. So we wouldn't blame long term State Street Corporation (NYSE:STT) shareholders for doubting their decision to hold, with the stock down 25% over a half decade. In contrast, the stock price has popped 9.8% in the last thirty days. However, this may be a matter of broader market optimism, since stocks are up 6.8% in the same time.
With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.
View our latest analysis for State Street
To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).
During the unfortunate half decade during which the share price slipped, State Street actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 6.1% per year. So it doesn't seem like EPS is a great guide to understanding how the market is valuing the stock. Alternatively, growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.
Because of the sharp contrast between the EPS growth rate and the share price growth, we're inclined to look to other metrics to understand the changing market sentiment around the stock.
Revenue is actually up 0.5% over the time period. A more detailed examination of the revenue and earnings may or may not explain why the share price languishes; there could be an opportunity.
The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).
State Street is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. You can see what analysts are predicting for State Street in this interactive graph of future profit estimates.
We're pleased to report that State Street shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 22% over one year. That's including the dividend. That certainly beats the loss of about 3% per year over the last half decade. The long term loss makes us cautious, but the short term TSR gain certainly hints at a brighter future.

Paytm FASTag user charged Rs 9 crore for NHAI toll!,2023-06-15T12:44:00.000000000+00:00,"New Delhi: A Paytm FASTag user recently reported that he was charged Rs 9 crore as NHAI toll at Mayar toll plaza near Hisar in Haryana. The user, who goes by profile name ‘gsratta’ on Team-bhp forum, said that he received a text message from Paytm stating that his Fastag has been blacklisted due to insufficient balance. When he checked the Paytm app, he saw that he had been charged Rs 9 crore whereas normal toll at the same toll plaza is Rs90.
“Today I received a text message from Paytm, that the Fastag of my vehicle has been blacklisted, due to insufficient balance, on checking in the Paytm application, I came to know that they had charged a whopping Nine crores ( yes that is true) see the attached screenshots. A popup came up to add ₹ 90000000/- to the Paytm wallet to continue using the fastag. Normal toll at the same toll plaza is ₹90. Contacted the helpline number, but it was not useful. How to proceed now. Please advise,” gsratta wrote on Team-bhp.
The user said that they contacted Paytm customer service, but they were unable to resolve the issue.

“The helpline automated system would not let me talk to a customer care person, instead it required me to raise the issue, in the Help & Support section of the Paytm Application. The result from the same was inconclusive. It doesn’t allow screenshots in the Help & Support section, so had to take pictures using another device,” he added.
Another Team-bhp member ‘Emvi’ meanwhile, shared a screenshot showing he was charged Rs 1.5 crore.
Both Emvi and gsratta, however, later confirmed in the forum that the issues were attributed to technical glitches and were subsequently resolved.
These were not first times for Paytm Fastag users to have been charged an exorbitant amount for toll. In 2022, a user was charged Rs 2 lakh for toll. Paytm had said that the charge was due to a technical error and had rectified the same.
Fastag is a prepaid toll collection system that uses radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. When a vehicle passes through a toll plaza, the RFID tag in the Fastag is read and the toll amount is deducted from the user’s account.
The Fastag system has been praised for its convenience and for reducing traffic congestion at toll plazas. However, the recent incidents have raised concerns about the reliability of the system. The NHAI and Paytm need to take steps to address these concerns and to ensure that the Fastag system is a reliable and convenient way to pay tolls.

Sony SAB launches digital campaign #HameshaKaHiKyun to promote its show ‘Vanshaj’,2023-06-15T12:44:00.000000000+00:00,"Sony SAB has launched a digital campaign #HameshaKaHiKyun for its new show ‘Vanshaj’. The campaign highlights the fact that only 15% of board members in Indian family businesses are women, and the percentage of women holding senior VP roles has decreased from 18% to 13%. The campaign aims to challenge gender stereotypes and advocate for inclusivity in leadership roles.
Sony SAB’s new family drama, ‘Vanshaj’ delves into the dynamics of a legacy business empire, challenging conventional patriarchal narratives. ‘Vanshaj’ aims to shatter the glass ceiling and emphasize that leadership and entrepreneurship should be determined by one’s abilities rather than gender.
“Sony SAB as a brand believes in real stories and real emotions, exploring new and more relevant themes that resonate with the lives of our viewers more closely. Vanshaj is one more forward-looking show from the channel which explores the challenges regarding inheritance even in today’s world. Using a sharp consumer insight helped us come up with a strong consumer campaign both for mass media and digital, riding on the understanding that most family-owned businesses often choose a male heir to take over the reins,” Vaishali Sharma, head of marketing, Sony SAB, said.
Since its launch, the campaign has gained traction by showcasing the lack of female representation in corporate leadership roles through a series of impactful videos. The success of the campaign reflects the growing desire for change and the need to amplify the voices of women leaders."

JetBlue introduces a new and blue standard livery: video,2023-06-15T12:35:49.000000000+00:00,"JetBlue has introduced a new standard livery for its aircraft, replacing the white-focused fuselages with an all-blue design.
The New York John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK)-based carrier revealed the new livery in a Twitter video, calling the new design a livery that got “a fresh bold look just like the moves we’ve been making as a travel company”.
In a separate press release, the airline explained that it has always “made big bold moves – and we’re matching those with a big bold update to our iconic liveries, with a blue allover fuselage, refreshed (and refreshing) accent colors, energized tailfin patterns that extend onto the body and belly, and more”.
According to JetBlue, the first aircraft to bear the new livery will be named “A Defining MoMint”. The Airbus A321, registered as N982JB, was delivered to the airline new in August 2017. Flightradar24.com data showed that the A321 was at Macon Middle Georgia Regional Airport (MCN), Georgia, United States (US) between May 29 and June 14, 2023, when it flew back to JFK.
Since then, the aircraft operated a round-trip itinerary to San Francisco International Airport (SFO), with another round-trip journey planned to SFO on June 15, 2023. Following the flight to SFO, however, the Airbus A321 is scheduled to fly to Las Vegas Harry Reid International Airport (LAS).
“Look for refreshed versions of our existing patterns to make their runway debuts as the rest of the fleet is repaint-ready,” concluded JetBlue.
Defining MoMint is equipped with 16 Mint suites, a “refreshing take on premium travel, plus a Core experience that’s tech-forward and trek-friendly, and a fully-stocked grab-and-go Pantry,” as described by the airline.
Previously, the aircraft was known as “One Mint, Two Mint, Blue Mint, You Mint”.
In total, JetBlue has 34 Airbus A321s equipped with Mint Suites, while another 28 A321s are configured in an all-economy 200-seat configuration."

Premier League debutants Luton will play their first top-flight fixture since 1992 away to Roberto De Zerbi’s Brighton on Saturday, August 12, having to wait until the following weekend for their first home game when Kenilworth Road will become the smallest ground to host a fixture in the competition for the visit of Burnley.
The other promoted side Sheffield United kick off their season with a home game against Crystal Palace.
The outstanding fixture of the opening weekend will be at Stamford Bridge where Mauricio Pochettino begins life as Chelsea manager against Liverpool on Sunday, August 13, with both sides looking to bounce back after disappointing campaigns.

Ex-Flipkart senior executive Goteti starts up again with travel fintech Scapia,2023-06-15T12:31:00.000000000+00:00,"Flipkart veteran Anil Goteti has embarked on a fintech venture. Scapia, which features a credit card and an app, allows customers to earn points earned on card spends to be redeemed for flights and hotel stays worldwide.
The card, introduced in partnership with Federal Bank and based on the VISA network, can be used in over 150 countries across a million merchants, enabling users to access transactions in real-time within the Scapia app.
“Scapia aims to rewrite the narrative by offering 10% rewards on every transaction, minting these rewards into Scapia coins,” the company said in a statement. “These coins then become your ticket to the world, redeemable for flights and hotel stays across the globe, with a user-friendly, one-click redemption on the Scapia app.”
The card also offers travel benefits like zero forex markup, unlimited domestic lounge access with zero joining and annual fees.
“Scapia is more than a credit card. It's a commitment to making travel accessible for everyone who dreams of seeing the world. It's a new way to reward young Indian travellers,” Goteti, who was earlier a senior vice president at Flipkart, said.
Scapia, which has been in stealth mode for over a year, is Goteti’s second independent foray in the startup space. ET in January 2022 reported that Goteti’s earlier venture, Protonn, shut its business and returned over $9 million to investors, which included the likes of Matrix Partners and Flipkart cofounder Binny Bansal.
Goteti, who headed some of Flipkart’s key businesses such as mobile, home and furniture categories, quit the e-commerce firm in November 2020 after an eight-year stint and set up Protonn the following year. The company, however, could not find the right product-market fit and the founders did not agree to pivot its business model.

Manchester United competing with Chelsea for Inter’s André Onana,2023-06-15T12:29:46.000000000+00:00,"Chelsea face competition from Manchester United for the signing of the Internazionale goalkeeper André Onana. United have also shortlisted Porto’s Diogo Costa as they target a challenger to David de Gea.
De Gea is out of contract this summer and yet to finalise a new deal. The Spaniard has been one of United’s best players since joining in 2011 but was inconsistent last season and Erik ten Hag wants to bring in a goalkeeper.
United are weighing up their next move after becoming discouraged in their pursuit of Tottenham’s Harry Kane. Signing a top striker is a priority for Ten Hag but Spurs do not want to sell Kane and Napoli’s asking price for Victor Osimhen is prohibitive. Atalanta’s Rasmus Højlund is a target, but the Dane is one for the future.
United must also decide whether to improve their offer for the Chelsea midfielder Mason Mount, after having an opening bid of £40m turned down. They could decide to spend heavily on a goalkeeper if they cannot sign a world-class No 9.
De Gea was at fault for Manchester City’s winner in the FA Cup final and his unconvincing distribution has raised doubts over whether the 32-year-old is suited to Ten Hag’s football. Chelsea and United have registered an interest in Onana with Inter, whose financial problems could force them to sell. It is believed the Cameroon international would favour a move to United. Costa is an alternative target for Ten Hag. The 23-year-old is highly rated and a Portugal international.
Onana is excellent with the ball at his feet and impressed during Inter’s run to the Champions League final, where they were beaten 1-0 by Manchester City. Inter fear they will lose Onana and have inquired about Brentford’s David Raya, who is wanted by Tottenham.
Signing Onana would fix a problem area for Chelsea, who will listen to offers for Kepa Arrizabalaga and Édouard Mendy. Arrizabalaga’s high wages could make him harder to sell than Mendy, who lost his place to the Spaniard last season. Chelsea have also targeted Milan’s Mike Maignan and Valencia’s Giorgi Mamardashvili.
Chelsea have held talks with Inter over a number of issues this week. Along with discussing Onana, Inter have explored signing Kalidou Koulibaly and Romelu Lukaku on loan. Chelsea need to raise funds and would prefer to sell Koulibaly and Lukaku.
Chelsea want £70m plus add-ons for Mount. They are expected to sell Mateo Kovacic to Manchester City and want £70m for Kai Havertz, who is a target for Arsenal."

Coinbase Announces Repurchase of 0.50% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2026,2023-06-15T12:20:00.000000000+00:00,"Coinbase Announces Repurchase of 0.50% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2026
Repurchasing $64.5 million of convertible senior notes at approximately 29% discount to par value
On June 14, 2023, Coinbase Global, Inc. (the “Company” or “Coinbase”) entered into separate, privately negotiated purchase agreements with a limited number of holders of its 0.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the “Notes”) to repurchase (the “Repurchases”) $64.5 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes. The Company estimates that it will expend approximately $45.5 million in cash to consummate the Repurchases. The transaction represents an approximately 29% discount to par value.
The Company previously entered into capped call transactions with certain financial institutions in connection with the initial issuance of the Notes. All of these transactions are expected to remain in effect notwithstanding the Repurchases.
The Repurchases are expected to close on or about June 20, 2023, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Following such closings, approximately $1.373 billion principal amount of the Notes will remain outstanding.
“We are always looking for the best opportunities to deploy capital to create shareholder value,” said Alesia Haas, Chief Financial Officer of Coinbase. “As we stated in our most recent shareholder letter, the first quarter of 2023 was a turning point in building a company that is more efficient and financially disciplined. This opportunistic repurchase is a continuation of those efforts and reflects our confidence in our business, strong first quarter financial performance, and improved competitive positioning. We have reduced our 2026 convertible senior notes outstanding and we will look for additional such opportunities in the future.”

"Uber Closes Delivery Business in Italy, Mobility Business in Israel",2023-06-15T12:19:00.000000000+00:00,"Uber Technologies is discontinuing its Uber Eats delivery business in Italy as well as its eponymous mobility business in Israel as Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi seeks to focus on markets where the group can be the first or second largest player.

UPDATE 2-Delta Air Lines resumes dividend suspended in 2020 during pandemic,2023-06-15T12:15:00.000000000+00:00,"(Adds Southwest action, more detail on Delta dividend)
June 15 (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines said on Thursday it would pay a quarterly dividend, resuming a payout that the carrier had suspended in March 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The dividend, of $0.10 per share, will be paid on Aug. 7 to shareholders of record as of the close of business July 17, the U.S. airline said.
In December, Southwest Airlines became the first major U.S. airline to reinstate its quarterly dividend, more than two years after suspending it in the wake of the pandemic.
The resumption of Delta's payout reflects its progress on its three-year financial plan, the airline said, including more than $10 billion of debt repayment over the last two years.
The move comes as Delta forecast that strong summer travel demand will result in higher-than-expected profit for the quarter through June.
As a condition of receiving $54 billion government assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic, airlines were prohibited from paying dividends or repurchasing stock.
Those restrictions expired last fall. Delta Air Lines received $11.9 billion in U.S. assistance.
In March 2020, Delta paid a $0.4025 share dividend, which was its 27th consecutive dividend at the time. (Reporting by Aishwarya Nair in Bengaluru and David Shepardson in Washington; Editing by Savio D'Souza and Alexander Smith)"

Real Madrid or Inter could give Man City fixture nightmare in Premier League and Champions League,2023-06-15T12:14:00.000000000+00:00,"Manchester City's fixture list for 2023/24 has thrown up plenty of nuances, with extremely difficult runs of games in October and March.
From October, City face Arsenal, Brighton, Manchester United, Chelsea, Liverpool and Tottenham in the space of seven Premier League fixtures, and the same group of games are reversed in the Spring.
In March, City will play United, Liverpool, Brighton and Arsenal all in a row, and around key Champions League fixtures to make the task even more difficult.
With six Champions League group games before Christmas, the fixture computer has thrown up some potentially difficult weeks where City are in European action either side of games that could turn out to be crucial in the league.
ALSO READ: Pep Guardiola's most feared fixture will come at the worst time for Man City treble defence
The Champions League group stage kicks off on September 19/20, in between a trip to West Ham and a home fixture with Nottingham Forest.
The second matchday of the group stage comes on October 3 or 4 after a trip to Wolves and before an eagerly-anticipated clash with Arsenal at the Etihad.
Later in October, City host Brighton, then play their next Champions League fixture on October 24 or 25, before travelling to Manchester United for the first derby of the season.
The matchday four fixtures are on November 7 or 8, and come in between a home clash with Bournemouth and a potentially tricky trip to Chelsea.
After the November international break, City welcome Liverpool in the Premier League, face a crucial matchday five on November 28 or 29 in Europe, and then host Tottenham immediately afterwards.
The final matchday - where City will hope to have secured qualification - comes between a first trip to Kenilworth Road to take on Luton, and a home meeting with Crystal Palace.
City are guaranteed a place in Pot One in the Champions League after winning the competition but could face Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid, Inter Milan, Borussia Dortmund, RB Leipzig or Porto from Pot Two. Selected other teams across Pots Three and Four include AC Milan, Real Sociedad and Celtic.
That means City could face a run of fixtures like Liverpool at home, Real Madrid away, and Tottenham at home - or Brighton at home, Inter Milan away, and Manchester United away.
Assuming City qualify for the last-16, the first leg could take place on one of two midweeks in February. Either it could be played in between Premier League home fixtures against Everton and Chelsea, or it could be played between the Chelsea game and a trip to Bournemouth.
The second leg will be played in the middle of a difficult March fixture list, either between United at home and Liverpool away, or between Liverpool away and Brighton away.
Should City progress to the quarter-finals, the first leg will come after the trip to Crystal Palace and before the visit of Luton. The second leg, a week later, will be played before the ever-difficult trip to Tottenham. However, should City or Spurs reach the FA Cup semi-finals, that would likely cause the Premier League game to be rearranged.
On to the potential semi-finals, and City face Nottingham Forest away before the first legs on April 30 or May 1. Then Wolves visit City at the weekend, before the second leg on May 7 or 8, and then a tricky trip to Fulham.

As we move through NFL mandatory minicamps this month and gear up for the start of 2023 training camps at the end of July, a handful of big-name players are amid negotiations for new contracts. So we checked in around the league on where things stand for 19 stars who could get paid this summer.
Could Justin Herbert and Joe Burrow reset the quarterback market after Jalen Hurts signed a $255 million extension in April and Lamar Jackson re-upped with Baltimore for $260 million over five years?

"Stellantis to close Illinois assembly plant, lay off workers",2023-06-15T12:11:38.000000000+00:00,"This is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated. Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.
BELVIDERE, Ill. (AP) — Hundreds of workers are expected to be laid off when automaker Stellantis closes an assembly plant in northern Illinois early next year, citing the challenge of rising costs related to the electric vehicle market and other factors.
Stellantis said Friday that its Belvidere Assembly Plant will be idled effective Feb. 28 as the company “considers other avenues to optimize operations.”
“This difficult but necessary action will result in indefinite layoffs, which are expected to exceed six months,” Stellantis said in a statement, adding that notices have been sent to hourly and salaried workers.
About 1,350 people are employed at the plant, which produces the Jeep Cherokee. Belvidere is about 70 miles (112 kilometers) northwest of Chicago.
“The company will make every effort to place indefinitely laid off employees in open full-time positions as they become available,” it said.
Stellantis was formed last year with the merger of Fiat Chrysler and France’s PSA Peugeot.
Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s administration has assembled a response team from the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity to help displaced workers find new employment, said Pritzker spokesperson Jordan Abudeyyeh.
She said the administration will work with local elected officials, community colleges and others to ensure appropriate retraining programs are available, and with Stellantis to find new uses for the Belvidere plant.
In 2016, then-Fiat Chrysler announced it would invest $350 million in the plant to produce the Jeep Cherokee. Production on the Cherokee began there in 2017.
Stellantis said Friday that the automaker is not commenting on the future of the “Cherokee nameplate.”
“This is an important vehicle in the lineup, and we remain committed long term to this mid-size SUV segment,” company spokesperson Jodi Tinson said in an email.
Stellantis, which also pointed to the coronavirus pandemic and global microchip shortage as challenges to the auto industry, said it is working to identify opportunities to repurpose the Belvidere facility."
Tesla short sellers are down billions after stock's winning streak,2023-06-15T12:11:00.000000000+00:00,"It's been an 'unprofitable trade' for Tesla shorts so far, analyst says
Tesla Inc. stock took a breather on Wednesday, snapping a 13-day winning streak, but it has more than doubled so far this year, creating a multibillion-dollar headache for those betting that the shares would fall.
There has been an increase in Tesla (TSLA) short selling for all of 2023, but ""we've recently seen short covering as its stock price has been rallying,"" said Ihor Dusaniwsky, a managing director at financial analytics firm S3 Partners. ""This has been a very unprofitable trade for Tesla short sellers.""
Tesla shares on Tuesday ended at their highest since late September after gaining for 13 straight sessions.
Real-time short-interest data from S3 Partners shows that Tesla shorts were down about $816 million in mark-to-market losses based on Tuesday's 3.5% jump for the stock.
Shorts have lost $12.68 billion in year-to-date mark-to-market losses, down 80%; they are down $5.05 billion, or 24%, so far in June. They had $15.85 billion in mark-to-market profits in 2022.

""With [Tesla's] stock price continuing its recent upward trend we should see continued short covering as the [Tesla] short squeeze tightens its hold on short sellers, especially those with less conviction,"" Dusaniwsky said.
After a difficult April, when it fell 20%, Tesla stock was on a tear in May, and has kept that up in June, gaining about 60% in the period. For the year, the stock has gained 110%, which compares with an advance of about 14% for the S&P 500 index.
The most recent gains for the stock came as Tesla saw its fast-charging standard becoming the de facto standard in the U.S.
Last week, Tesla and General Motors Co. announced that GM EV owners would have access to Tesla's ""Supercharger"" network, usually located near major highways.
GM also said that its future EVs would conform to the Tesla-developed North America Charging Standard, or NACS, by 2025, and before that the automaker would offer an adapter. That follows a similar move by Ford Motor Co. last month
Tesla CEO Elon Musk said back in July 2021 that he would open Tesla's Supercharger to other EVs, although he promised that would happen by the end of 2021.
Tesla created its own connector because there were no standards when it became the only maker of long-range EVs, Musk said then.
Other EVs began to be allowed to charge at Tesla's fast-charging stations last year, but the GM (GM) and Ford (F) announcements brought the matter to the forefront.
GM, Ford and other automakers currently use the Combined Charging System, or CCS, as their charging connection, which is standard in most EVs in Europe and other regions. Tesla has made NACS open source, which means more products that use it are hitting the market.

"Uber to shut food delivery business in Italy, exit Israel",2023-06-15T12:10:00.000000000+00:00,"Uber said on Thursday it will shut its food delivery business in Italy and exit Israel, where it has not built sufficient market share.
The moves were ""in line with our efforts to focus on markets where we have opportunities for sustainable growth"", a company spokesperson said.
CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has said Uber will invest only in markets where it can be the largest or second largest player.
Uber trails Just Eat and Glovo in Italian food delivery, and Gett Taxi and Yango in the Israeli taxi and private hire market.
The company, which relies on self-employed contractors for its delivery service, said around 50 Uber employees and thousands of non-employee couriers and restaurants would be affected in Italy.

Manchester United eyeing shock move for Leeds defender Robin Koch,2023-06-15T12:09:00.000000000+00:00,"Robin Koch has emerged as a shock target for Manchester United, who have him on their shortlist for defensive reinforcements this summer, according to reports in Germany.
The versatile defender has been with Leeds since signing from Freiburg in 2020, making 73 Premier League appearances over three seasons before the Yorkshire side were relegated to the Championship.
The Germany international is not expected to continue with the club in the second tier, although Manchester United are a somewhat unexpected interested party.
However, Sky Sport Germany’s Florian Plettenberg reports that Koch is indeed on the Red Devils’ shortlist and ‘loose talks’ have even taken place over a move.
Koch’s contract at Elland Road expires next year so the club will likely be happy to cash in on him while they can, with the likes of Newcastle and Arsenal also reported to hold an interest in him.
The 26-year-old did state in March that there had been initial discussions over a new deal with Leeds, although nothing has been signed and that was before they were relegated from the top flight.
‘During the season, I want to distract myself as little as possible with future planning,’ he told German outlet Spox three months ago. ‘Initial talks are currently underway between the club and my agent.
‘Towards the end of the season, and during the summer break, I will deal with it. Now, my focus is 100 per cent on our games and goals.’
Koch has won eight caps for Germany and offers some versatility as he can play in central midfield as well as his usual position of centre-back.
Leeds paid £13m for him in 2020 and despite now being in the Championship, they would expect to make a profit on that with huge Premier League clubs interested in him.

"India's debt burden likely to decline, key determinant of fiscal strength will be affordability: Moody's",2023-06-15T12:05:00.000000000+00:00,"Moody's Investors Service on Thursday said the key determinant of India's fiscal strength and the credit profile will be debt affordability and projected a downward trend for the debt burden. ""As long as nominal GDP growth holds, India's debt burden will be stable or decline slightly,"" Moody's said.
In a report, it said India's fast-growing GDP, which is estimated to average 11 per cent in nominal terms, is a key driver of the projections of a downward trend in the country's debt burden.
""As in the past, the key determinant of fiscal strength and the credit profile will be debt affordability and in particular the proportion of revenue absorbed by interest payments,"" Moody's said.
India has a relatively high level of general government debt, estimated at around 81.8 per cent of GDP for 2022-23, compared with the Baa-rated median of around 56 per cent.
The country also has a low debt affordability, in terms of general government interest payments as a percentage of revenues, which for India is estimated at 26 per cent for 2022-23, compared with the Baa median of around 8.4 per cent.
""At 26 per cent currently, it is a large proportion, which, if not further addressed via a continued broadening of the revenue base, will remain an important constraint on the government's ability to provide more support for growth and address developmental needs,"" Moody's added.
Moody's has a 'Baa3' sovereign credit rating on India, with stable outlook. Baa3 is the lowest investment grade rating.
On Friday, Moody's is scheduled to meet Indian government officials during which the latter is likely to make a strong pitch for a sovereign rating upgrade."
3 reasons why we’re really excited about the Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds,2023-06-15T12:03:03.000000000+00:00,"More details have just dropped about the Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds. The successor to Sony’s best true wireless earbuds has been the subject of several leaks in recent weeks – one of which revealed great news for those with smaller ears. Further details have also been found in a leaked spec sheet.
And now there’s a newer, better leak via WinFuture.de that includes what appear to be promotional images (above) and more details about what the new earbuds will offer. And it looks like they’re going to be pretty special.
Here are three reasons why we’re excited about the Sony WF-1000XM5.
1. You don’t need to have a massive head
For all their many joys, the Sony WF-1000XM4 earbuds are hefty both in terms of dimensions and in weight. But the new 1000XM5 buds are significantly smaller and a lot lighter too. Each earbud is reportedly 1.4g lighter than before, bringing the weight down to 5.9g per earbud, and the case is 2g lighter too. The case doesn’t really matter to me, but as someone who’s worn larger earbuds for long periods I’m all in favour of smaller and lighter.
2. They’re probably going to sound better
A slimmer design means new drivers, and the latest reports say that the new drivers here are Dynamic Driver X with a diameter of 8.4mm. They’ll be accompanied by two new proprietary chips to support Hi-Res Audio and Sony’s DSEE Extreme audio tech and promise better microphones too.
3. They’re getting an extra battery
WinFuture reports that there’s an additional battery in the WF-1000XM5 case, which extends the total running time of the earbuds to 24 hours and gives you an hour of playback from just three minutes of charge. A full charge takes two hours.
How much will Sony’s WF-1000XM5 cost?
Those are the big three reasons, but there’s more. Bluetooth 5.3 with multi-point should make it easy to connect to all your kit, and the buds are IPX4 certified for water and sweat so they should be a good option for runners and gym-goers.
We don’t yet know when these buds will go on sale or what their price tag will be, but we’ll be very surprised if they’re not priced similarly to the current model, which retails for $279.99 / £250 / AU$449.95.
If you can’t wait for the Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds to drop and need some new headphones for the summer, then take a look at our guide of the best earbuds, which features other Sony earbuds worth considering.

Those who invested in Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) three years ago are up 25%,2023-06-15T12:02:00.000000000+00:00,"Low-cost index funds make it easy to achieve average market returns. But if you invest in individual stocks, some are likely to underperform. For example, the Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) share price return of 16% over three years lags the market return in the same period. Unfortunately, the share price has fallen 8.6% over twelve months.
Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns.
Check out our latest analysis for Bank of America
While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.
Bank of America was able to grow its EPS at 11% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. This EPS growth is higher than the 5% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems investors have become more cautious about the company, over time. We'd venture the lowish P/E ratio of 8.57 also reflects the negative sentiment around the stock.
The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).
It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Bank of America's earnings, revenue and cash flow.
What About Dividends?
When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Bank of America the TSR over the last 3 years was 25%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.
Bank of America shareholders are down 6.1% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 20%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 2% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk. , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.

KLA's (NASDAQ:KLAC) investors will be pleased with their incredible 376% return over the last five years,2023-06-15T12:02:00.000000000+00:00,"We think all investors should try to buy and hold high quality multi-year winners. And we've seen some truly amazing gains over the years. For example, the KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) share price is up a whopping 336% in the last half decade, a handsome return for long term holders. And this is just one example of the epic gains achieved by some long term investors. Also pleasing for shareholders was the 24% gain in the last three months. But this could be related to the strong market, which is up 11% in the last three months.
With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.
Check out our latest analysis for KLA
While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.
Over half a decade, KLA managed to grow its earnings per share at 41% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 34% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.
The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).

What About Dividends?
When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for KLA the TSR over the last 5 years was 376%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.
It's nice to see that KLA shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 57% over the last year. That's including the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 37% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand KLA better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks, for example - KLA has we think you should be aware of.

Investors in CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) have unfortunately lost 6.2% over the last year,2023-06-15T12:01:00.000000000+00:00,"It's easy to match the overall market return by buying an index fund. But if you buy individual stocks, you can do both better or worse than that. Unfortunately the CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) share price slid 11% over twelve months. That contrasts poorly with the market return of 20%. On the other hand, the stock is actually up 2.9% over three years.
Since shareholders are down over the longer term, lets look at the underlying fundamentals over the that time and see if they've been consistent with returns.
View our latest analysis for CME Group
To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.
During the unfortunate twelve months during which the CME Group share price fell, it actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 2.9%. It could be that the share price was previously over-hyped.
By glancing at these numbers, we'd posit that the the market had expectations of much higher growth, last year. But other metrics might shed some light on why the share price is down.
CME Group's dividend seems healthy to us, so we doubt that the yield is a concern for the market. From what we can see, revenue is pretty flat, so that doesn't really explain the share price drop. Unless, of course, the market was expecting a revenue uptick.

We like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. So we recommend checking out this free report showing consensus forecasts
What About Dividends?
It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, CME Group's TSR for the last 1 year was -6.2%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!
CME Group shareholders are down 6.2% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 20%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 5% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand CME Group better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks, for example - CME Group has we think you should be aware of.
CME Group is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find this

AbbVie announces European Commission approval of Rinvoq® for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease,2023-06-15T12:00:54.000000000+00:00,"RINVOQ® is the first and only oral JAK inhibitor approved to treat Crohn’s disease in Europe
AbbVie, a US-based pharmaceutical company, has announced that its oral Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitor, RINVOQ® (upadacitinib), has been approved by the European Commission for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease in adult patients who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to conventional therapy or a biologic agent.
This marks the seventh indication for upadacitinib in the European Union, and the first and only oral JAK inhibitor approved to treat Crohn’s disease.
The European Commission approval is supported by data from two induction studies, U-EXCEED and U-EXCEL, and the U-ENDURE maintenance study. Statistical significance was achieved for the co-primary endpoints and key secondary endpoints with upadacitinib 45mg in the induction studies and upadacitinib 15mg and 30mg in the maintenance study compared to placebo.
A significantly higher proportion of patients treated with upadacitinib achieved the co-primary endpoints of endoscopic response and clinical remission and the key secondary endpoint of corticosteroid-free clinical remission at weeks 12 and 52 compared to placebo.
Safety results in Crohn’s disease were generally consistent with the known safety profile of upadacitinib
Upadacitinib is approved in the EU for the treatment of adults with radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, as well as adults and adolescents with atopic dermatitis.
Laurent Peyrin-Biroulet, MD, PhD, professor of gastroenterology and head of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease group at the Gastroenterology Department, University Hospital of Nancy, France, said: “These studies demonstrated upadacitinib’s ability to achieve key treatment targets, including endoscopic outcomes and symptomatic relief, that are critical for patients and beneficial for long-term care.”"
Only Connect host points out similarities to fresh New York Times game,2023-06-15T12:00:27.000000000+00:00,"The New York Times is beta testing a game called Connections which has gained attention for its similarities to a round featured in BBC2 quiz show Only Connect.
In both games, players are shown 16 clues which must be categorised into four groups of four. Once a category is correctly identified, the clues are grouped together at the top of the board and asasigned a colour.
The only notable difference is that Connections refreshes each day and players can only make four mistakes (akin to Wordle), whilst in the Connecting Wall (as it's known on Only Connect) players must solve the wall in two and a half minutes. Connecting Wall players have unlimited guesses until they've found two categories, after which they are only given three incorrect attempts.
Watch on YouTube
The similarities did not escape the notice of Only Connect viewers or host Victoria Coren Mitchell.
Coren Mitchell responded to New York Times puzzles editor Wyna Liu on Twitter, asking Liu ""do you know this has been a TV show in the UK since 2008?! It's so similar I guess you must do?""

Baltimore Ravens Sign 2023 NFL First-Round Pick To Improve Offensive Plays Next Season,2023-06-15T12:00:00.000000000+00:00,"KEY POINTS
The Ravens have added another wide receiver after coming to terms with Zay Flowers
Flowers' signing means the Ravens have signed all their 2023 NFL Draft picks
Odell Beckham Jr. continues to work his way back with Ravens
The Baltimore Ravens have wrapped up their offseason program, highlighted by the signing of 2023 NFL Draft pick Zay Flowers.
According to Adam Schefter of ESPN, the Ravens have come to terms with the former Boston College product on Wednesday, June 14.
The scribe reported that per the player's agents, Eric Dunn and Matt Leist of Loyalty Above All (LAA), Flowers agreed to a four-year, $14 million guaranteed contract that included a $7.2 million signing bonus that will be paid this year.
Flowers was the third wide receiver off the board following successive picks of four wide receivers.
Looking ahead, the 22-year-old player is expected to provide the Ravens with a huge boost on the offensive end under the watch of coordinator Todd Monken.
The Florida native is described as a quick and elusive wide receiver.
Last season with Boston College, Flowers caught 78 passes last season with Boston College for 1,077 yards and 12 touchdowns.
With this, he has been compared to former Ravens wide receiver Steve Smith.

The Ravens held their last mandatory camp on Thursday, June 15. Training will officially start in late July.
The official signing of Flowers comes not long after Beckham made his debut at minicamp.
The one-time Super Bowl champion got back into the field for the first time after nearly 16 months.
Although it wasn't that pretty, it was a meaningful one to the wide receiver.
That included catching a pass from Lamar Jackson after he playfully did some pushups after slipping, which resulted in limited practice.

Audi chief sets sights on China in electric car catch-up,2023-06-15T11:59:49.000000000+00:00,"INGOLSTADT, Germany :Audi has to speed up development of new models to meet a surge in demand for electric vehicles, especially in China, the German luxury carmaker's CEO said in an interview with Reuters published on Thursday.
""We are in the process of reviewing our entire development process,"" Markus Duesmann said.
Advertisement
The company needs new and shorter production cycles for the areas of connectivity and software. ""And we are also looking more intensively at how this is done in China,"" Duesmann said.
""I expect that over time we will get close to a development time of 30 months,"" he added. That compares with a current time of more like 48 months.
The Volkswagen subsidiary has lagged behind fellow German carmakers BMW and Mercedes-Benz in the pivot towards battery-electric vehicles (BEV).
""In 2030, the BEV share of the premium car market should already be between 60 and 70 per cent, depending on the region,"" Duesmann said. ""We have to react when a market suddenly changes so quickly.""
That shift could happen even sooner in China, but Audi's sales performance in the world's biggest car market has fallen short of expectations. The reason, Duesmann said, is that ""we still don't have the optimal vehicles on the market for Chinese needs"".
Advertisement
From January to March, Audi sold just over 3,000 electric cars in China.
Local heavyweight BYD, meanwhile, overtook the VW brand in the first quarter to become China's top marque with a total market share of 11 per cent, including traditional combustion-engine cars.
SOFTWARE DELAYS
Unlike BMW and Mercedes, Audi has not brought out any major additions to its model range over the past two years.
The new Q6 e-tron has been delayed by behind-schedule software development.
Advertisement
Its release, now set for the end of the year, marks the launch of a product offensive, with Audi aiming to bring more than 20 new models onto the market by 2025, half of them powered by electric motors.
From 2026, Audi doesn't plan any new combustion-engine models.
Hoping to offset any disappointment in China, Duesmann said the carmaker wanted to strengthen its business in North America, tapping into a strong U.S. car market and Washington's generous subsidies programme.
Audi's strategy ""has been reinforced by the Inflation Reduction Act"", the CEO said, referring to the programme.
Audi has a plant in Mexico and is currently considering an expansion of its production capacity in the region, perhaps at VW's site in Tennessee.

A decision on this will ""definitely be made this year,"" Duesmann said."

$10 trillion asset manager and top banks are betting big on Bitcoin (BTC)
Blue-chip banks and corporations are increasing their bets on Bitcoin (BTC) by purchasing MicroStrategy (MSTR) stocks. In recent months, they injected a massive amount of liquidity in MSTR, Bitcoin Culture newsletter reports.
Their authors tracked the activity of two heavyweight asset management firms, BlackRock and Fidelity, plus Bank of America, in terms of their exposure to MSTR, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin (BTC).
For corporations that are not interested (or limited) in buying Bitcoin (BTC) directly, MSTR shares usually serve as a reliable proxy investment to get exposure to Bitcoin (BTC) price performance.
That said, both BlackRock and Fidelity are in the top five of MSTR stock owners. As reported by CNN, in recent months, Fidelity increased its exposure to MSTR more than sevenfold.
Bank of America also increased its MSTR share through BofA Securities Inc. Its stake size spiked by over 47,000%, as displayed by Bitcoin Culture.
Largely, institutions are underwater at current Bitcoin (BTC) prices
Also, MSTR stocks are aggressively accumulated by the largest Canada banks and investment platforms from all over the globe.

Fixed income trading will drop 15% to 20% compared with the bumper quarter a year earlier, Chief Financial Officer James von Moltke said Thursday. Analysts were expecting a decline of about 12%.
“We are seeing the trail-off in macro, but actually still quite encouraging activity despite all the things we’ve been through - debt ceiling and what have you,” von Moltke said at an investor conference hosted by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in Paris. “But compared to this outstanding” period last year, “we’re naturally going to have a step-back.”
The German lender’s shares extended losses after the comments, falling as much as 2.4% in Frankfurt trading.
Deutsche Bank joins Wall Street firms in flagging weaker debt trading, as interest rates near their peak and the economy is likely to enter a recession. JPMorgan Chase & Co. expects revenue from investment banking and trading to each decline 15% from a year ago, and Goldman Sachs has warned of a slump in trading that could exceed 25%. Bank of America Corp. expects its traders to be roughly flat.
A drop of as much as 20% would continue a trend that started in the first quarter, when Deutsche Bank reported 17% lower fixed income revenue. The lender in April announced plans to cut about 800 senior back-office staff as Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing steps up cost reductions in response.
The trading slowdown is driven by weaker demand for products that allow investors to bet on interest rate or foreign exchange movements, von Moltke said. Overall, however, the environment for banking isn’t all bad, he said, with asset prices holding up."

These sponsors diluted their stake through an initial public offering (IPO) in 2020 by selling 38,987,081 shares for Rs 2,100 crore. The entire proceeds of the offer went to all the promoters, including T Rowe Price.
The IPO came after the markets regulator Sebi order dated December 6, 2019, directing LIC, SBI and BoB to reduce their stake by December 2020, failing which, the regulator would freeze their excess voting rights.
Last year, PNB received government approval to divest its entire stake in UTI Asset Management Company Limited as part of its non-core asset sale plan to shore up its capital base.
DIPAM, last year, allowed Public Sector Enterprises (PSEs) wanting to divest stake in their subsidiaries to submit the proposal to their respective administrative ministries.
Earlier, the sale of majority or minority stakes in subsidiaries or units of PSEs was undertaken by the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM).
After the Cabinet in June allowed PSEs to decide and implement stake sales in their subsidiaries, the DIPAM on Thursday laid down guiding principles for strategic disinvestment/minority stake sale of PSE subsidiaries/units or their joint ventures.
As per the guidelines, the board of holding/parent PSE would recommend strategic disinvestment/minority stake sale of its subsidiaries/units/JVs to the administrative department, which would examine the proposal and send it to DIPAM.
DIPAM would then seek 'in-principle' approval of the Alternative Mechanism (AM) on disinvestment, chaired by the Union Finance Minister.
The decision of the AM would be communicated to the parent public sector enterprise, following which its board would undertake the transaction.
UTI Mutual Fund was created in 1964 after Parliament passed the Unit Trust of India (Transfer of Undertaking & Repeal) Act in 2002 after the flagship US-64 scheme went bankrupt. Post the Act, the then mighty UTI was bifurcated into Specified Undertaking of Unit Trust of India (Suuti), which owns almost 11.8 per cent of Axis Bank and UTI Asset Management Company.
The Baltimore-based T Rowe Price picked up 26 per cent in UTI in November 2009 by buying a 6.5 per cent stake each from the four promoters for USD 140 million."

MLB DFS Fantasy picks to make today
Marcus Stroman gets to continue his magical season for the Chicago Cubs against the Pittsburgh Pirates today. He's sporting a 2.42 ERA and the Pirates likely won't change that very much. He's a safe MLB DFS Fantasy pick.
The potential AL Cy Young in Nathan Eovaldi is on the bump for the Texas Rangers. While the Los Angeles Angels boast a red hot Shohei Ohtani, Eovaldi should pitch well once again.
Cristian Javier is 7-1 with a 3.13 ERA this season for the Houston Astros. Those numbers will probably get even better against the lowly Washington Nationals.

Reliance in talks for $2 billion loan to fuel expansion,2023-06-15T11:47:00.000000000+00:00,"Reliance Industries Ltd. is in talks with lenders for a foreign-currency loan of up to $2 billion to fuel the ongoing expansion of its oil-to-telecoms business, according to people familiar with the matter.
The sprawling firm, controlled by Asia’s richest man Mukesh Ambani, plans to use India’s dedicated external commercial borrowing route to secure the loan, the people said, asking not to be identified because the discussions are private.
The facility may have a maturity period ranging between three to five years, one of the people said, and the proceeds will be used for capital expenditure and to refinance another loan that matures in September.
Lenders involved in the discussions include Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and Standard Chartered Plc, one of the people said. Spokespeople for those banks declined to comment, while a representative for Reliance said they couldn’t immediately comment.
Ambani is raising funds as he continues to build out the telecoms and consumer-facing arms of an empire based on a bedrock of crude-oil refining. Reliance’s expansion spree has been fueled by generous borrowings after the firm managed to achieve net debt zero status in 2020.
Reliance has said it aims to invest $75 billion in renewable energy over 15 years and last year acquired the $3 billion streaming rights to the highly coveted Indian Premier League cricket tournament. The firm is also rolling out 5G network services across the South Asian nation, which is expected to cost $25 billion.

This 32-inch 1440p LG monitor is just £229 from Overclockers,2023-06-15T11:43:32.000000000+00:00,"Another day....another solid monitor deal. This time it's from Overclockers on an LG monitor, the 32GN600-B to be exact. If you're wanitng a larger gaming monitor to play on with a good spec list, this is available from Overclockers for just £229. which seems like a great deal.
Get the LG 32GN600-B for £229 from Overclockers (was £279)
A 2560x1440 resolution screen makes this LG panel immediately a great fit for a mid-range gaming PC or laptop. Moreover, you're getting a VA panel here, with all of the benefits to contrast that provides, as well as a 165Hz refresh rate and FreeSync Premium support to offer a smoother output without any tears or juddering. The fact also remains that you're getting a larger 32-inch screen, giving you more screen real estate to take advantage of, making this an excellent choice for more cinematic titles. The 165Hz refresh rate offered makes the 32GN600-B a fantastic choice for more competitive titles where you'll really feel the benefits of smoother and faster motion, although the chances are that you'll also generally notice a silkier experience even on the Windows desktop and in other titles, too.
This particular LG monitor also comes with a solid 350 nits of brightness, as well as a 3000:1 contrast ratio, aiding performance in darker scenes. A quoted colour space coverage of 95 percent of the sRGB colour space makes the monitor a reasonable choice for content creation too, as well as offering up HDR10, to accentuate detail in darker scenes, in theory at least. With this in mind, the 350 nits of brightness this LG monitor offers isn't enough to really take advantage of the powers of HDR. The monitor has both DisplayPort and HDMI outputs, suitable for a wide range of PCs, laptops and consoles, with the best performance permitted by the DisplayPort option - on HDMI, you'll be limited to 1440p 120Hz with VRR.
It should also be said that the 32GN600-B looks fantastic with a virtually borderless frame, complete with a mean-looking grey chassis and flecks of red to add a bit of flair. Its stand offers a good level of adjustment with some tilt adjust, and its port selection is pretty good, too, with that pair of HDMI out and a DP 1.4, as well as a headphone jack.
£229 isn't really a lot of money for a monitor as powerful as this one, and if you're in the market for a larger monitor with a whole lotta features, this is a fantastic choice."
"SAT refuses interim order on Sebi decision in Subhash Chandra, Punit Goenka matter",2023-06-15T11:40:00.000000000+00:00,"After hearing both parties, the SAT posted the matter for final disposal on Monday
Mumbai: The Securities Appellate Tribunal on Thursday sought the Securities and Exchange Board of India's (Sebi) response within 48 hours to a plea filed by Essel Group's Subhash Chandra and Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd.'s Punit Goenka challenging the regulator’s recent order. The tribunal refused to pass any interim order in the matter.
Sebi, in its order on Monday, restrained both Goenka and Chandra from holding any key managerial positions in any listed firms following allegations that they were involved in siphoning off funds.
After hearing both parties, the SAT, in an oral order, posted the matter for final disposal on Monday.
The SAT bench led by Justice Tarun Agarwala held that “We are of the opinion that passing an interim order at this stage will be virtually allowing the appeal. Consequently, we are of the opinion that we will decide the appeal finally, in this regard parties have agreed that they will file the replies at the earliest. Let replies be filed within 48 hours (2 days).""
Janak Dwarakadas, senior counsel representing Goenka in the matter argued that Sebi’s order is a ‘sham’. “I can demolish the order with strong points. We will be able to establish in two minutes that there was no investigation into this case and that this is a sham,"" he said.
“Even if the order is stayed, my (Goenka’s) reputation will be tarnished. What happens to my reputation and fundamental rights? If any authority of law thinks that fundamental rights can be trifled in such shabby manner, then we have much more to worry about as citizens"", Dwarkadas argued.
He argued before the bench that in Sebi’s order Goenka was alleged of using funds from a publicly listed company as his “piggyback"" which was virtually disruptive.“His reputation can never be restored"", Dwarkadas said.Adding that the order is likely to have significant impact since Goenka has not only been barred to hold key position but such positions in any listed entities.
The senior counsel also informed the tribunal regarding the pending approval from the NCLT in the ZEE- Sony merger case. “Sebi’s order will effectively derail the proposed merger between ZEE and Sony"", he said. Adding that merger has been approved by 96% of the shareholders of the company.
Senior counsel Somsekharan Sundaresan appearing for Subhash Chandra, while citing the Sebi’s 12 June order stated that the above facts make out a prima facie case of Chandra and Goenka having abused their position as directors/KMPs of a listed company for siphoning off funds for their own benefit. Further, although the promoter Family is only holding 3.99% shares in Zee, Subhash Chandra and Punit Goenka continue to be at the helm of affairs of Zee.
The senior counsel argued that Chandra currently is not at the helm of affairs at Zee and Sebi is wrong in mentioning so in its order. He added that Chandra is neither a director nor any key managerial personnel in any listed company or its subsidiaries. “If I am not a key director what is the need for the direction?""the counsel said."
Google Lens now uses AI to identify skin conditions,2023-06-15T11:39:09.000000000+00:00,"Google is expanding the capabilities of its computer vision-powered app, Google Lens, with a range of new features.
The app, which uses artificial intelligence to identify objects and provide relevant information, can now identify and surface skin conditions, such as moles and rashes. Users can upload pictures through Lens, initiating a search for visual matches.
The feature is not as advanced as the AI-driven skin, hair and nail condition diagnostic app that Google launched in the European Union in 2021.
The diagnostic app faced obstacles in the United States, where it would have required approval from the Food and Drug Administration, a step Google chose not to pursue. However, the Lens feature can still be valuable for individuals who are unsure whether to seek medical attention or try over-the-counter treatments.
Additionally, Google announced that Lens is integrating with Bard, the company's AI-powered chatbot experience. Users can now include images in their interactions with Bard, and Lens will assist Bard in understanding and providing accurate responses. For instance, if a user shows Bard a photo of shoes and asks for their name, Bard, informed by Lens' analysis, will provide an answer.
These updates are part of Google's ongoing investment in generative AI technologies, with a focus on enhancing the capabilities of Bard.
Last week, Google introduced a new capability that allows Bard to write, execute, and test its own code, improving its problem-solving and programming abilities. In May, Google collaborated with Adobe to enable art generation within Bard."

Latin American country joins Russia’s Visa alternative,2023-06-15T11:37:00.000000000+00:00,"Venezuela has begun to accept Mir cards, the head of the country’s central bank announced at SPIEF
Venezuelan banks have begun to accept Mir cards, Russia’s alternative to Visa and Mastercard, the head of the country’s central bank, Calixto Jose Ortega Sanchez, revealed at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF) on Thursday.
The Latin American country announced it was willing to join the Mir payment system last year and has since been in talks over the step. The Russian Embassy in Venezuela previously said that if Caracas connected to Mir, this would “create stable conditions for settlements in national currencies” between the two countries.
Russia’s Mir payment system has experienced a steady increase in demand for new cards since last year, according to the system’s operator. Around ten countries worldwide currently use the system, while roughly 15 others have expressed interest in adopting it.
The head of Myanmar’s central bank declared at SPIEF on Wednesday that his country would start accepting Mir cards by December. An agreement was also recently reached with Iran.

In March, Cuba announced the launch of Russia’s alternative to Western payment cards. Several banks in Havana have installed ATMs displaying the logo of the Mir system, and offer the option to withdraw cash using Russian bank cards in Cuban pesos.
Russia started developing its own national payment system after the US targeted it with sanctions in 2014. After Moscow was hit with further sanctions last year in response to the launch of its military operation in Ukraine, including the blocking of many Russian banks from SWIFT, the government began to promote its domestic version, SPFS, as a reliable alternative. The Russian system ensures the transfer of funds between banks inside and outside the country.

The Giants announced Jones’ death on Wednesday night.
""Homer Jones had a unique combination of speed and power and was a threat to score whenever he touched the ball,"" Giants CEO John Mara said, via the team’s website.
""He was one of the first players (if not the first) to spike the ball in the end zone after scoring a touchdown and he quickly became a fan favorite. I remember him as an easygoing, friendly individual who was well liked by his teammates and coaches.""

The Houston Oilers selected Jones in the fifth round of the 1963 AFL Draft but he never ended up playing for them. The Giants selected him in the 20th round of the 1963 NFL Draft and he made his first appearance with the team in 1964.

He finished his career with 224 catches for 4,986 yards and 36 touchdowns.
Most notably, Jones is credited as the first person to spike the football after a touchdown. After seeing superstar players of the time like Frank Gifford and Paul Hornung throw the ball into the stands after a score and get fined for it, Jones would spike the ball on a touchdown grab when he started the first game of his career in 1965.
""I was fixing to throw it into the grandstand,"" Jones recalled to ESPN in 2015. ""But just as I was raising my arm, the reality snapped into my head. (NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle) would have fined me. That was a lot of money in those days. So, I just threw the ball down into the end zone, into the grass. Folks got excited, and I did it for the rest of my career.""

Star Ocean 2 remake seemingly leaked on Square Enix site,2023-06-15T11:30:58.000000000+00:00,"Space-Ships
A mysterious new logo is being shared online this morning, purportedly an as-yet-unannounced new project in the popular fantasy franchise, Star Ocean. As reported by RPGSite, a banner for a “Star Ocean The Second Story R” was first discovered on the support site of IP owner Square Enix.
Originally released for PlayStation in 1998, Star Ocean: The Second Story is, as the name suggests, the second entry in the action-RPG series, which won over fans with its sci-fi/fantasy storytelling, myriad paths and conclusions, and very heavy emphasis on dating mechanics between multiple characters, allowing players to essentially dictate both narrative and gameplay through the pairing (or not) of relationships.
The “R” in the new banner suggests that this popular release may be in line for the remake/remaster treatment, though obviously, Square Enix is yet to speak on the discovery. Back in 2019, the publisher released the similarly titled Star Ocean First Departure R on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, which was itself a remaster of the PlayStation Portable (PSP) port of the first game in the series. Thus, a continuation along these lines is very likely, and very good news for Star Ocean fans.
Of course, we will be sure to keep you updated should Square Enix be forthcoming with any news.

Australian opposition party expels senator over sexual misconduct allegations,2023-06-15T11:29:03.000000000+00:00,"CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Australia's main opposition party expelled a senator on Thursday after a female senator accused him of sexual assault and a former senator said he squeezed her buttocks, in the latest evidence of a toxic culture in Parliament House that is hostile to women.
Opposition leader Peter Dutton said he expelled Sen. David Van from the conservative Liberal Party following allegations made in Parliament on Wednesday night by independent Sen. Lidia Thorpe of harassment and sexual assault. Van remains a senator, but no longer represents the Liberal Party.
Van denied the allegations, which were made under parliamentary privilege, under which no one can be sued for defamation over anything said in the Senate.
But he has yet to respond to the statement that followed from former Liberal Party Sen. Amanda Stoker that said Van had apologized for ''squeezing my bottom twice"" at Parliament House.
“I would have preferred that the matter be resolved privately and finally — as I thought it was. However, following Sen. Thorpe’s allegations, it is now clear that is no longer tenable,” Stoker said.
Political leaders apologized last year to staffers who have endured decades of bullying, harassment and sexual assault inside Parliament House which were exposed by an investigation by the national sex discrimination commissioner.
The investigation was triggered by a staffer's allegation that she was raped while drunk by a colleague in a minister’s office in 2019.
The staffer accused the then conservative government of treating her rape allegation as a political problem and of dissuading her from complaining to police.
Thorpe told the Senate on Thursday that Van harassed her around the time that the staffer's complaints captured national media attention two years ago.
The previous government had agreed with Thorpe’s request to shift Van to a different office to reduce their interaction walking to and from the Senate.
The Associated Press does not normally identify alleged victims of sexual assault but Thorpe made the accusations publicly.
Thorpe said Van groped her in a stairwell where there were no security cameras.
“There are different understandings of what amounts to sexual assault. What I experienced was being followed, aggressively propositioned and inappropriately touched,” Thorpe tearfully told the Senate.
She said she would not complain to police or sue in a civil court but had complained to the independent Parliamentary Workplace Support Service, which handles workplace complaints.
Van welcomed the service’s investigation of what he described as “outrageous claims.”
“Sen. Thorpe’s allegations are concocted from beginning to end. Nothing that she has alleged about me is truthful,” Van told the Senate.
There is a pattern of Australian male lawmakers using sexist and abusive behavior to undermine their female opponents.
Dutton didn't mention Stoker but suggested Thorpe’s allegations were not the only reason Van was expelled from the party.
“Since the airing of Sen. Thorpe’s allegation yesterday, further allegations in relation to Sen. Van have been brought to my attention overnight this morning,” Dutton told reporters.
“I’m not making any judgment on the veracity of allegations or any individual’s guilt or innocence. I make that very clear. Obviously, there’s an independent process with the Parliamentary Workplace Support Service to get under way,” Dutton said."

Meta's stellar stock rally has room to run further, according to Evercore ISI's head of Internet research.
Mark Mahaney thinks Meta is currently the ""best play"" in tech stocks as the stock remains relatively cheap based on some valuation metrics.
""It's the cheapest, high-quality large-cap tech stock out there,"" he told CNBC.
Meta Platforms shares have surged a staggering 127% this year, but the stock still has room to rally because it looks relatively cheap based on some valuation metrics, according to the head of Evercore ISI's Internet research team.
""Meta is actually still your best play,"" Mark Mahaney told CNBC on Wednesday. ""I know it's had a huge year-to-date rally, but it's trading at 15 times GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) earnings - it's the cheapest, high-quality large-cap tech stock out there.""
""There's a lot of upside in that stock,"" he added.
Mahaney expects Meta's favorable ""product cycles"" to help quicken revenue growth, while its cost-cutting plans should boost profit margins.
Tech stocks have outperformed this year after a dismal 2022, benefiting from the hype over artificial intelligence as well as investor expectations that the Federal Reserve will soon end its aggressive interest-rate increases.
""They had been so whacked down last year in terms of their multiples, in terms of estimates and then you had RIFs – reduction in force – which just meant the multiples were de-risked, the estimates were de-risked,"" Mahaney said, explaining how valuation metrics had turned favorable for tech stocks this year.

Tesla Cybertruck spotted in camouflage wrap. This is how Elon Musk reacts to leaked image,2023-06-15T11:27:00.000000000+00:00,"The Tesla Cybertruck, a highly anticipated electric vehicle globally, has generated significant interest since its introduction in 2019. Despite multiple projected production timelines, the electric pickup truck has not yet begun manufacturing.
Elon Musk has announced that production of the Cybertruck will begin in September 2023, and recently, there have been frequent sightings of prototypes of the vehicle, some of which have been covered in camouflage wraps.
Contrary to the high expectations surrounding the Cybertruck, previous sightings of its prototypes did not feature any camouflage. However, the most recent prototype spotted in a real-world setting stood out because it was the first-ever Tesla Cybertruck prototype observed with official factory camouflage.
In Palo Alto, California, a recent sighting of a Tesla Cybertruck prototype revealed that it was concealed by a camouflage vinyl wrap. The discovery was shared on the Cybertruck Owners Club forum, and upon inspection, there were no discernible differences from previously spotted prototypes. This occurrence is surprising because Tesla has historically shown little enthusiasm for using camouflage wraps on its test prototypes, resorting to this practice only on rare occasions.

It is possible that this represents a new strategy aimed at attracting more attention, or it could indicate that the company is reconsidering its stance on the use of camouflage wraps. Typically, automakers employ such wraps on their test prototypes of new or updated models to conceal design details, proportions, and other features that are not yet known to the public.
After the camouflaged prototype images of the Tesla Cybertruck gained widespread attention on Twitter, CEO Elon Musk amusingly remarked, ""Good thing we used camo lol."" Production of the Cybertruck is scheduled to commence in September of this year at the Giga Texas factory in the United States.

Initially, the electric pickup truck will be manufactured in limited quantities. However, Tesla CEO Musk has disclosed that the production rate will escalate from 2024 onwards."
BTC Halving Events Provide Little Guidance for Next One: Coinbase,2023-06-15T11:26:04.000000000+00:00,"It is possible that the next bitcoin (BTC) halving, expected in second-quarter 2024, will have a positive impact on the cryptocurrency’s performance, but that’s not a foregone conclusion, Coinbase (COIN) said in a report Wednesday.
“Getting a clear picture of how markets reacted to previous bitcoin halving episodes requires disentangling the effect of liquidity, rates and U.S. dollar movements,” analyst David Duong wrote.
The halving of the block reward is often viewed positively because it enhances bitcoin’s “prospective scarcity” and supports its supply/demand dynamics, the note said. When bitcoin halving occurs, rewards are cut by 50%.
Still, with only three recorded halving events in the past, evidence of how markets react is limited, the note added. It is difficult to see a clear pattern, particularly as the events were “contaminated by factors like global liquidity measures,” the report said.
Coinbase says global liquidity appears to have peaked in the near term, noting that there’s still another 9-10 months till the next halving, “which makes it unclear what the net effect on bitcoin’s price behavior might be.”
Retail demand for the largest cryptocurrency is likely to remain strong ahead of the event, according to Wall Street giant JPMorgan (JPM)."
Is North Korea's Phishing Website Trying To Steal South Koreans' Personal Data?,2023-06-15T11:23:00.000000000+00:00,"KEY POINTS
As per South Korea's spy agency, the North Korean phishing portal is replicating the sign-in page of Naver
Naver is South Korea's largest online portal and search engine
The NIS said the agency was taking necessary action to safeguard the users' details
Seoul's spy agency National Intelligence Service (NIS) has alleged that North Korea is engaged in a cyber espionage campaign aimed at stealing the personal data of South Koreans.
The NIS stated North Korea was operating a phishing website that replicated South Korea's largest online portal and search engine, Naver, in real time. This website was designed to trick users into revealing their personal information, according to Reuters.
The NIS has issued a warning to the public, urging them to exercise caution and remain vigilant regarding web addresses to protect themselves from falling victim to such cyberattacks.
In a press release, the spy agency stated that North Korea has been making efforts to acquire user data through multiple counterfeit Naver websites. These deceptive websites are designed to appear as legitimate Naver platforms, but are operated by malicious actors from North Korea.
The National Intelligence Service emphasized the need for heightened caution among internet users to avoid falling prey to these fraudulent websites.
""If the domain address is not the legitimate Naver access domain ― www.naver.com ― such as www.naverportal.com, please immediately stop accessing it,"" the NIS said in the release, Wion reported.
As per the NIS' findings, the North Korean phishing portal is replicating the sign-in page of Naver. By creating counterfeit login pages that closely resemble the authentic Naver sign-in page, the intention is to trick South Korean users into entering their login credentials. Once users unknowingly provide their usernames and passwords, the people behind the fake website gain unauthorized access to their genuine Naver accounts.
The recent counterfeit websites created by North Korea have advanced capabilities that enable them to mirror real-time content from Naver, including news, ad banners, finance information, and other data displayed on the Naver homepage.
""Their cyberattack techniques have evolved to improve the possibility of stealing personal information,"" an official at the NIS said, according to Reuters.
In an effort to safeguard citizens, NIS has shared pertinent information with the government, public institutions, and the Korea Internet & Security Agency. These organizations have taken swift action to implement measures aimed at blocking access to phishing sites.
To track the North Korean phishing sites effectively, the NIS is actively cooperating with international agencies by sharing relevant information as the servers are located overseas.

The projected fair value for BJ's Wholesale Club Holdings is US$104 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity
BJ's Wholesale Club Holdings' US$62.20 share price signals that it might be 40% undervalued
The US$77.39 analyst price target for BJ is 25% less than our estimate of fair value
Does the June share price for BJ's Wholesale Club Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:BJ) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.
Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model.
See our latest analysis for BJ's Wholesale Club Holdings
The Model
We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:

Google's big AI push: Four AI-powered features in Gmail you can use,2023-06-15T11:17:00.000000000+00:00,"Google’s AI push continues to get stronger with each passing week. The tech giant has revealed a host of AI-related features that are now in Gmail, the world’s most popular email service. Here are four AI-powered features in Gmail that you can use:
Use Smart compose
Not a new feature as such but extremely useful. According to Google, Smart compose uses a hybrid language generation modeland runs it on Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) to show wording suggestions. A simple tap of the “Tab” button accepts the suggestion and incorporates those words into your email draft without you having to fully type them out, explains Google.
Tabbed inbox
If you are a Gmail users, then you would have seen how there are different inboxes for different things. Primary, Promotion and Social are among the few tabbed inboxes Gmail has. Gmail uses machine learning on a classification system, which then decides where the email should go. The messages then go into one of five different inbox tabs: Primary, Promotions, Social, Updates and Forums. (You can use as many or as few of these tabs as you want.) “To automatically categorise these emails, Gmail uses a combination of neural network-based machine learning and heuristic algorithms (heuristic algorithms use AI-generated decision trees to make choices),” Google said in a blog post.
Summary cards
Another feature that has been pretty much around for a while and uses AI and machine learning is Summary Cards. Any time you book a flight and get a ticket in your inbox, chances are a summary card will appear, giving you the important details in a concise manner. Google says that this done by “using heuristic and machine learning algorithms, summary card technology automatically looks for certain data from inbound emails to understand what type of message it is and the most important content in the message.”
Need a nudge?
Nudging is the first Gmail AI feature that runs on both emails you have received and sent. It is a feature that reminds you to reply to a mail or an important message. “For inbound emails, Nudging uses a machine learning model to detect which emails you haven’t replied to and predict which of them you’d normally answer,” explained Google in a blog post."

Tesla’s Record Winning Streak Starts to Unwind After 41% Surge,2023-06-15T11:10:00.000000000+00:00,"A day after snapping its longest-ever winning streak, Tesla Inc. is embarking on a losing run.
The stock slid 3.2% as of 7:04 a.m. in New York premarket trading, having fallen 0.7% on Wednesday to halt 13 straight sessions of gains.
Tesla rose 41% in a 13-day ascent through Tuesday, pushing the world’s most valuable automaker deep into overbought territory. Its relative strength index rose to 88 earlier this week, far above the level of 70 that signals to some technical analysts that a stock may have risen too far, too fast.
The rally was fueled by positive newsflow that included General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co. making moves to adapt their electric vehicles to Tesla’s Superchargers, Tesla Model 3 sedans becoming eligible for the full US tax credit, and a broader investor hunger for artificial intelligence stocks.
However, the hawkish stance taken by the Federal Reserve on Wednesday has caused shares of the year’s biggest winners to take a breather. Nvidia Corp., which has led megacap tech stocks higher this year, also fell in premarket trading, set to snap a five-day winning streak. Nasdaq 100 Index futures were trading down 0.7%

Huawei Is Not Getting 5G Chips From Qualcomm; the Rumors Are Fake!,2023-06-15T11:09:38.000000000+00:00,"In case you are unaware, the US banned the use of telecommunications equipment from foreign firms deemed a national security risk. Huawei is also placed on a trade blocklist, which restricts most US suppliers from supplying goods and technology to the company. It was part of an executive order that came into effect on May 15, 2019.
But on June 12, 2023, a rumor was circulating in the Chinese media sources. It stated that the US would be allowing Qualcomm to sell 5G chipsets to Huawei. People from the industry backed the rumor by stating that the US has loosened its strictness for some chip export.
Those were some big claims. And if they turned out to be true, Huawei could jump right into the global competition and launch 5G smartphones. It would have also ramped up Qualcomm’s business. But on June 13, 2023, the head of Huawei Consumer Business Group denied the report!
Huawei Is Not Getting 5G Chipsets From the US, But There’s Good News

"Stellantis invests 100 million euros in startups, mobility fund",2023-06-15T11:08:00.000000000+00:00,"DETROIT (Reuters) - The venture capital arm of automaker Stellantis said on Thursday it will invest about 100 million euros ($108.3 million) in automotive and battery technology startups and a mobility venture fund.
Stellantis Ventures, created last year with 300 million euros of initial capital, will put money in ten startups ranging from Nauto, which provides driver monitoring and risk-management technology to fleets, to battery technology startup Electra Vehicles, to Beweelsociety, an electric bike venture started within Stellantis, Adam Bazih, head of Stellantis Ventures, said in a videoconference.
Stellantis said it will offer Nauto technology on commercial fleet vehicles beginning this summer.
Stellantis Ventures will put an undisclosed amount into a mobility venture fund that Bazih said he could not name because it has not finalized regulatory paperwork.
The company is one of several established automakers that have set up venture capital arms to gain access to new technology and talent.
""They are high-risk bets,"" Bazih said, acknowledging volatility in capital markets. Venture capital investments can go wrong 70 to 80% of the time, he said. ""The 20% .. .hopefully carries the rest.""
Other startups getting funding from Stellantis in this round include:
6K, which makes materials used in batteries and 3D printing.
Envisics, augmented reality displays.

"Morgan Stanley reinstates this mobile carrier as a top pick, says shares could surge nearly 40%",2023-06-15T11:05:44.000000000+00:00,"“Patience should be rewarded,” Morgan Stanley said about T-Mobile shares. The firm reinstated T-Mobile to its list of top picks in telecom services. Analyst Simon Flannery maintained his overweight rating on shares, while increasing his price target by $1 to $178. His target price implies 39% upside from where shares closed on Thursday. “T-Mobile is one of the only companies in our coverage (along with Iridium) with a sizable buyback program who is able to take advantage of market volatility. The company offers investors low leverage, strong FCF generation, a recurring revenue model, network leadership, growing market share and reasonable valuations,” Flannery wrote in a Thursday note. The analyst said the recent weakness in the telecom services sector creates an opportunity for T-Mobile to execute the rest of its $14 billion share buyback program at lower prices, “creating more value for shareholders.” Flannery noted temporary headwinds from wholesale traffic off-loading by DISH and Verizon are temporary headwinds to T-Mobile shares. The company’s ability to outperform the sector may become harder as it gains more market share, he added. Shares are down more than 8% year to date. The stock is still up 1.2% over the past 12 months. Morgan Stanley said it expects the stock “to break out of this range over the next few months driven by operating and technical factors.” The firm expects T-Mobile to continue to take share in the wireless industry while its newly-launched 5G plan supports service revenue growth.
