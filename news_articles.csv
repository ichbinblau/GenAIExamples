Dáil almost suspended after Sinn Féin TD put pager in front of Minister during firefighters debate,2023-06-15T14:32:11.000000000+00:00,"The Dáil was almost suspended on Thursday afternoon after Sinn Féin TD John Brady walked across the chamber and placed an on-call pager in front of the Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien during a debate on retained firefighters.
Mr O’Brien said Mr Brady had taken part in “an act of theatre” that was “obviously choreographed”.
Around 2,000 retained firefighters around the country staged a second day of industrial action on Tuesday and are due to start all out-strike action from next Tuesday. The mostly part-time workers, who keep the services going outside of Ireland’s larger urban centres, are taking industrial action in a dispute over pay and working conditions.
Speaking in the Dáil, Sinn Féin deputy leader Pearse Doherty said firefighters had marched on Leinster House today and were “very angry” at “the fact the Government will not intervene”.

“An intervention is required now. I’m asking you to make an improved offer in relation to pay for retained firefighters,” Mr Doherty told the housing minister.
“I’m also asking you, and challenging you, to go outside after this Order of Business and meet with the firefighters because they are just fed up to the hilt in relation to what you said.
“Some of them have handed in their pagers to members of the Opposition and have challenged you to wear the pager for the next number of weeks, put up with an €8,600 retainer and not leave your community for the two and a half kilometres and see how you can stand over those type of pay and conditions.”
At this point, Mr Brady got up from his seat, walked across the chamber and placed the pager on the desk in front of Mr O’Brien. Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl said the Sinn Féin TD was “completely out of order” and told him not to “carry out a charade in this House”, adding it was “absolutely outrageous behaviour and not to be encouraged”.
Mr O’Brien said Mr Brady had engaged in “an act of theatre here today which was obviously choreographed” and was then interrupted with shouts from the Opposition benches. Mr Ó Fearghaíl said he would suspend the House “if this racket continues”.
Mr O’Brien later said he said he was confident the dispute could be resolved and he had “immense regard” for firefighters. The minister said he would encourage the unions to re-engage with the State’s industrial relations process while also accusing Sinn Féin of using the issue for their “own political gain”.
“You see what happened here today, you’re shameless and people see through it,” he told Mr Doherty."
Epic’s latest tool can animate hyperrealistic MetaHumans with an iPhone,2023-06-15T14:00:00.000000000+00:00,"Today, Epic is releasing a new tool designed to capture an actor’s facial performance using a device as simple as an iPhone and apply it to a hyperrealistic “MetaHuman” in the Unreal Engine in “minutes.” The feature, dubbed MetaHuman Animator, was detailed at the Game Developers Conference in March but is now available for developers to try out for themselves. Epic has also released a new video today produced by one of its internal teams to show what the tool is capable of.
While Epic’s short film shows off some impressively subtle facial animation, the big benefit the company is emphasizing is the speed with which MetaHuman Animator produces results. “The animation is produced locally using GPU hardware, with the final animation available in minutes,” the company’s press release reads. That has the potential to not just save a studio money by making performance capture more efficient but also, Epic argues, it could allow them to experiment and be more creative.
“Need an actor to give you more, dig into a different emotion, or simply explore a new direction?” Epic’s press release asks. “Have them do another take. You’ll be able to review the results in about the time it takes to make a cup of coffee.” Facial animation can be applied to a MetaHuman character “in just a few clicks,” Epic says, and the system is even smart enough to animate a character’s tongue based on the performance’s audio.
Performance capture using iPhones has been possible in the Unreal Engine since at least 2020 with the launch of Epic’s Live Link Face iOS app, but now, it’s combined with the high level of detail promised by Epic’s MetaHuman technology. As well as working on the iPhone 12 and up (which is capable of capturing both video and depth data), Epic says MetaHuman Animator can also be used with “existing vertical stereo head-mounted camera [systems] to achieve even greater fidelity.”
Epic says the Blue Dot short film released today should give some idea of what its animation tool is capable of. It was produced by Epic Games’ 3Lateral team and stars actor Radivoje Bukvić delivering a monologue based on a poem by Mika Antić. Although Epic says it’s possible to tweak animation post-capture, it claims “minimal interventions” were made on top of the MetaHuman Animator’s performance capture to achieve these results.
If you want to learn more, Epic has released an instructional video on how to use the tool. Documentation is also available via the MetaHuman hub on the Epic Developer Community."
"EU to Ban Huawei, ZTE from Internal Commission Networks",2023-06-15T13:50:00.000000000+00:00,"The European Commission is planning to ban equipment from Chinese vendors Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp. from its own internal telecommunications networks, people familiar with the matter said.
The ban comes ahead of an anticipated update to the European Union’s guidance on 5G mobile networks within the bloc that’s expected to more forcefully encourage members to phase out equipment from the companies, which it considers high risk, the people said, asking not to be identified because the plan isn’t yet public.
As the relationship between the US and its allies and China has deteriorated, countries have blocked Chinese technology from their core telecommunications networks because of spying concerns. The move is similar to the commission’s decision to block its staff from using TikTok Inc. over security concerns related to the social-media app’s data-collection practices.
Read More: TikTok Banned From EU Commission Phones Amid Security Fears
In the EU’s review of the 5G “toolbox,” the commission will say that publicly excluding Huawei and ZTE from national networks is justified and will explicitly call out Huawei and ZTE as high-risk vendors by name for the first time. The majority of countries have yet to ban the two Chinese vendors from their networks.
Representatives for Huawei and ZTE didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

"Arsenal have Rice bid rejected, new Premier League fixtures released, Man United out of Harry Kane race, Chelsea reject Mason Mount bid",2023-06-15T13:31:42.000000000+00:00,"Jude Bellingham has also insisted his move to Real Madrid had nothing to do with money, as he explained how his transfer was wrapped up so quickly.
“Money is not a thing for me,” he said.
“I dont think about money at all when I make these kinds of decisions. I never have and I never will. I play the game purely out of love.
“I spoke with people from Real Madrid when I was given permission by Borussia Dortmund and I love the feeling I got from the club. I couldn’t hide it. I told them straight away what I felt and after that happened on Monday it all happened quickly.”
He also opened up on how he was given the No.5 shirt, which was worn by defender Jesus Vallejo last season, and what it means to him to have Zidane’s old number on his back.
“For a start I’d like to thank Jesus Vallejo for letting me wear the No.5,” he explained.
“I contacted him just to see if it was OK with him and he was just a brilliant guy, he let me wear it and was just so nice about it, so I’m very grateful to him.
“I’ve said in many interviews how much I admire Zidane, the legacy he has at the club and the legacy of his number.
“I’m not trying to be the same as him, I’m just trying to be Jude, but it’s definitely a bit of a homage to how great he was.
“As for the 22, it’s a number that has a lot of meaning to me and in my heart I’m still a 22, I’m just wearing the No.5 on my back.
“We’ll see what happens in the future, but right now I’m really happy to be given this honour of wearing this number.”"
Ryanair sacks chief pilot over sexual misconduct claims,2023-06-15T13:30:00.000000000+00:00,"Reuters
Ryanair has sacked its chief pilot after an investigation into his alleged sexual harassment of female colleagues.
The airline told staff that he had been fired for ""a pattern of repeated inappropriate and unacceptable behaviour towards a number of female pilots"".
The chief pilot, named in reports as Aidan Murray was appointed in 2020 and had been with the airline for 28 years.
Ryanair declined to comment ""on queries relating to individual employees"".
According to The Independent, Mr Murray allegedly harassed nine junior colleagues, including sending text messages to some with comments on their bodies.
Mr Murray, 58, is also accused of altering flight rosters to fly with certain female pilots.
In a note to staff, Ryanair's chief people officer, Darrell Hughes, said Mr Murray's employment had been ""terminated with immediate effect"".
An investigation found his behaviour ""was in breach of our anti-harassment policy"". Ryanair said staff should be able to come to work ""in a safe and secure environment"".
""We would ask all of you to respect the privacy and integrity of those brave individuals who came forward to assist us in this investigation,"" Mr Hughes added.
The Financial Times reported that Mr Murray has seven days to launch an appeal against his dismissal.
The BBC has attempted to contact Mr Murray for comment.
The job of chief pilot is an important one. The holder is both a highly qualified airline captain and a manager, responsible for overseeing other pilots based at a hub airport.
They are usually in charge of issues such as training, flight coordination and rostering as well as addressing personal issues. They can also represent the airline in disciplinary issues.
As such, they have a lot of power over their fellow pilots, particularly more junior ones seeking promotions.
The suggestion that someone in this position might be abusing their power - and behaving in an ""inappropriate and unacceptable"" way towards female staff - is therefore a very serious charge.
It's important to note that we haven't heard the other side of the story. But it appears that whistleblowers have come forward - and have been listened to.
Against that background, the dismissal should come as no surprise.
A report last year by the Royal Aeronautical Society into discrimination and lack of diversity in airline pilot training found ""extremely concerning"" reports of sexism and sexual harassment by many female pilots.
Although many had positive comments on their training, reports of sexism and harassment ranged from ""banter"" to ""uncomfortable advances from male trainers"".

"Vivo X90s Officially Teased, Tipped to Run on New MediaTek Dimensity 9200+ SoC",2023-06-15T13:07:00.000000000+00:00,"Vivo X90s has been teased by Jia Jingdong, Vivo's Vice President and General Manager of Product Strategy via Weibo on Thursday. The new smartphone has a design similar to its Vivo X90 series siblings — Vivo X90 and Vivo X90 Pro. The Vivo X90s is shown to have a Zeiss-tuned triple rear camera unit. The upcoming model is expected to retain the key specification of the Vivo X90. Meanwhile, Chinese tipsters have leaked the specifications of the upcoming handset. The Vivo X90s is said to run on MediaTek Dimensity 9200+ SoC and could be offered in four different colour options.
Jia Jingdong posted an image of the Vivo X90s on the Chinese microblogging platform providing us a glimpse of the design from the rear. The render shows the handset in a white finish with rounded corners. The image suggests Zeiss branded triple rear cameras on the rear panel along with an LED flash. It seems to have a glass back with the Vivo branding at the bottom.
Vivo, however, didn't confirm the exact launch date or key specifications of the Vivo X90s.
Separately, several Chinese tipsters posted specifications of the upcoming Vivo X90s on Weibo. According to the tipsters, the handset will be powered by the latest MediaTek Dimensity 9200+ SoC. This would be an upgrade over the MediaTek Dimensity 9200 SoC found on the vanilla Vivo X90. The new model is said to offer Wi-Fi 7 connectivity and could be offered in black, blue, green, red, and white colour options. The Vivo X90, in contrast, has Wi-Fi 6 and is available in China Red, Ice Blue, and Original Black (translated from Chinese) in China.
A TENAA listing from May revealed the specifications of the Vivo X90s. As per the listing, it will have a 6.78-inch 1.5K (1,280 x 2,800 pixels) curved AMOLED display. The screen has a centre-aligned hole-punch cutout at the top. It is listed to carry up to 16GB of RAM along with up to 1TB of inbuilt storage.
Oppo, OnePlus, Realme to Operate as Separate Entities in India: Report
The triple rear camera setup of the handset could include a 50-megapixel main camera sensor, accompanied by a 12-megapixel ultra-wide lens, and a 12-megapixel portrait sensor. It is said to pack a 32-megapixel selfie camera as well. Vivo is expected to provide a 4,690mAh battery on the Vivo X90s.
The Vivo X90 Pro has finally made its debut in India, but is the company's flagship smartphone for 2023 equipped with enough upgrades over its predecessor?

BofA Surpasses $500 Million in Equity Investments to Support Minority and Women Entrepreneurs,2023-06-15T13:05:00.000000000+00:00,"Investments in Diverse-led Funds Result in Capital Deployed to Over 1,000 Companies Across the U.S.
NEW YORK, June 15, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Bank of America today announced that it has committed more than $500 million in equity investments to minority- and women-led funds, more than doubling its initial $200 million commitment.
The bank has committed equity to more than 150 funds, which to date have invested in over 1,000 companies that span 40 states. These companies are led by 1,500 diverse entrepreneurs and employ over 21,000 people.
""We work across our company to address critical needs in our communities, including the lack of access to capital that diverse business owners face as they start or grow their businesses,"" said Tram Nguyen, Global Head of Strategic and Sustainable Investments at Bank of America. ""We want to empower the talented fund managers who keenly understand how to identify and support those business owners. Each time we support a minority- or women-led fund, they in turn support diverse entrepreneurs, which ultimately helps us toward achieving our goal to advance racial equality and economic opportunity.""
Not only are fund managers breaking down barriers themselves, but they are also investing in companies looking to catalyze change. As a graduate of a Historically Black College and University (HBCU), Nasir Qadree founded Zeal to provide overlooked founders with the resources they need to scale towards their next stage of growth. This includes being an early investor in Esusu, now one of the few Black-owned unicorns, which provides tools to help immigrants and minorities to provide rent reporting and data solutions for credit building.
Chingona Ventures, led by General Partner Samara Hernandez, was the only active fund in the Midwest started and led by a Latina at the time of Bank of America's investment. The fund targets founders with unique backgrounds creating businesses in markets that are often overlooked, like Papaya, a bilingual STEM tutoring organization to close the educational gap for underserved students.
Bank of America continues to innovate and expand the capital and resources entrepreneurs and small business owners of all backgrounds need to help fuel economic growth in their communities. More on Bank of America's work in supporting diverse funds and entrepreneurs can be found here.

UnitedHealth's stock selloff chopped more than 200 points off the Dow's price,2023-06-15T13:02:00.000000000+00:00,"Health insurer's stock suffers second-biggest price decline since it starting trading 39 years ago
Shares of UnitedHealth Group Inc. took a dive Wednesday to suffer their worst percentage performance in three years, after the health insurer said it was facing higher costs from pent-up demand for surgeries.
The stock (UNH) was by far the biggest decliner within the Dow Jones Industrial Average , and was among the worst performers in the S&P 500 , along with fellow health insurers with Medicare Advantage exposure.
UnitedHealth's stock dropped 6.4% to a one-year closing low of $459.86. That was the biggest percentage decline since it sank 7.2% on June 11, 2020.
The stock's price decline of $31.45 was the second-biggest since it started trading in October 1984, behind only the $47.00 (17.3%) plunge on March 16, 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The selloff was cut about 207 points off the Dow's price, as the Dow fell 232.79 points, or 0.7%, while the S&P 500 gained 0.1%.
The selloff comes after Chief Financial Officer John Rex said late Tuesday at a Goldman Sachs investor conference that there were indications of ""pent-up demand"" from senior citizens to have hip and knee procedures and cardiology checkups, which could hurt results from UnitedHealth's Medicare business.
Oppenheimer analyst Michael Wiederhorn said while other insurers that presented at recent conferences didn't mention similar trends, he believed UnitedHealth's comments will weigh on the entire sector.
He said rival Humana Inc. (HUM) was potentially the most exposed, given its larger Medicare Advantage presence. And on cue, Humana's stock was the S&P 500's biggest decliner, tumbling 13.8%.
Some of the S&P 500's other big losers were also in the Medicare Advantage business, as Centene Corp.'s (CNC) stock sank 6.9%, Elevance Health Inc. (ELV) shares shed 6.8% and CVS Health Corp.'s (CVS) stock slid 7.8%.
UnitedHealth's stock has an outsized impact on the Dow's price
UnitedHealth's stock is the highest-priced component of the Dow, which is a price-weighted index, unlike the S&P 500, which is a market-capitalization-weighted index. That means the stock's moves affect the Dow more than any other component.
At Wednesday's closing prices, a 1% move in UnitedHealth's stock represents about a 30-point move in the Dow, while a 1% move in Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.'s (WBA) stock, which is the lowest priced, has about a 2-point effect on the Dow.

Houston Texans Come To Terms With Ex-Third-Round Pick Defensive Tackle,2023-06-15T13:00:00.000000000+00:00,"KEY POINTS
The Texans have signed Maliek Collins to a two-year deal
Collins becomes latest defensive player to settle a contract with a mother team
J.J. Watt has yet to properly file his retirement with the NFL
The Houston Texans have ramped up their defensive needs with the reported signing of Maliek Collins on Wednesday, June 14.
According to Adam Schefter of ESPN, both sides sealed the deal on a contract extension with Collins accepting a $23 million contract extension.
""The deal was negotiated by Texans' GM Nick Caserio and director of football administration Andrew Brown with Collins' agents Drew Rosenhaus and Ryan Matha,"" the scribe wrote on his Twitter post
The new deal gives Collins a bit of a raise and reportedly includes a $20 million guarantee.
In his previous contract, the 28-year-old was earning $17 million with $8.5 million of that guaranteed.
This will be his third year in the NFL, having had previous stops with the Dallas Cowboys (2016-2019) and the Las Vegas Raiders (2020).
The Kansas native had a career-high 37 tackles to go with 3.5 sacks over 15 games last NFL season.
He is projected to be a key piece in the defensive line of the Texans for the next couple of years.
Looking ahead, Collins is expected to fit in nicely with the 4-3 alignment that DeMeco Ryans is expected to implement.
He is likely to become a full-time defensive tackle according to Sam Robison of Pro Football Talk.
With the Texans in rebuilding mode, Collins was seen as one of the bright spots for the team. He started 15 games between 2021 and 2022, combining for six sacks and 18 tackles for a loss.
Now, he will be paid better, which means he will have added responsibility–particularly on the defensive side of the Texans' fence.
The Collins deal also comes not long after other defensive tackles landed new deals with their respective teams. That list includes Dexter Lawrence, Daron Payne, Jeffery Simmons and Ed Oliver.
There are still other names expected to land new contracts this NFL offseason. Yet to come to terms with their teams include Chris Jones of the Kansas City Chiefs and Quinnen Williams of the New York Jets.
In related news, there remain questions in the air on whether J.J. Watt is officially retired.
According to a report by CBS Sports, Watt has yet to fill out his retirement papers with the NFL.
This was despite his retiring last NFL season in an emotional game that saw him record two sacks in his allegedly final NFL game.
Moreover, the five-time first-team All-Pro does not intend to sign a one-day deal with the Texans although this is tied to him being inducted into the club's Ring of Honor.
""I personally just don't really understand or see the reason for it,"" Watt stated. ""It's more just a ceremonial piece of paper. I think that the Ring of Honor and all that comes with it is more than enough."""
NFL Rumors: What Patriots ‘Made Clear’ To DeAndre Hopkins’ Reps,2023-06-15T13:00:00.000000000+00:00,"The Patriots apparently didn’t waste any time courting DeAndre Hopkins once he hit the open market.
Hopkins officially became an NFL free agent when he was released by the Arizona Cardinals on May 26. Around that juncture, New England reportedly reached out to the star wide receiver’s team to express interest. Those conversations birthed a free-agent visit, which reportedly started Wednesday in Foxboro, Mass. and carried into Thursday morning.
“I just got official word: DeAndre Hopkins is in New England,” NFL insider Jeremy Fowler said Thursday on ESPN’s “Get Up.” “He’s meeting with the Patriots. He will meet with the coaches, Bill Belichick. The Patriots’ interest remains high. They made that clear with Hopkins’ representatives from the very beginning when he became a free agent. So, we’ll see if they can close on this thing.”
Hopkins has received co-signs from New England team leaders like Mac Jones and Matthew Judon, and the Patriots reportedly are optimistic they can add the five-time Pro Bowl selection. But even if Hopkins’ meeting with the Patriots goes well, don’t be surprised if the 31-year-old leaves New England without a deal.
“I’m also told Hopkins (is) not in a major rush,” Fowler said. “He’s looking at more of training camp, even early August as more of a harder deadline for him to sign somewhere. So, it would have to be a very sweet offer for New England to make that happen today.”
The Patriots appear to be the second team Hopkins met with as a free agent. Prior to his trip to New England, the veteran pass-catcher talked shop with the Titans in Nashville."

"Gordon McQueen, former Manchester United and Leeds player, dies at 70",2023-06-15T13:00:00.000000000+00:00,"MANCHESTER, England — Gordon McQueen, a defender who played for Manchester United, Leeds and Scotland’s national team, has died. He was 70.
McQueen’s death was announced Thursday via a statement from his family released by Man United.
McQueen was diagnosed with vascular dementia in 2021.
“We hope that as-well as creating many great football memories he’ll be remembered most for his character,” his family said. “Our house was always full of friends, family & football just as it was in his last few months as he fought so bravely in what became a very cruel battle against dementia.
“The disease may have taken him too soon but he definitely lived life to the full, the ultimate entertainer, the absolute heart and soul of every occasion, the most fun dad anyone could wish for.”
McQueen began his career at Scottish club St. Mirren and went on to play in England. He was Britain’s most expensive player when he joined Man United for 495,000 pounds (now $626,000).

He won the English league title with Leeds and the FA Cup with Man United. He also made 30 international appearances for Scotland.
After his playing career, McQueen briefly managed Scottish team Airdrieonians and coached St. Mirren and Middlesbrough.
United said McQueen “oozed command and charisma” at the heart of its defense.
“Everyone at Manchester United is heartbroken by the loss of our beloved former defender, Gordon McQueen,” the club wrote on Twitter. “Our love and condolences are with his family at this terribly sad time.”
Leeds also said it was “saddened” to learn of his passing.
“Gordon was one of the best center backs I had the privilege of playing with,” former Man United teammate Bryan Robson said. “He was a perfect fit for Manchester United with his flair, courage and big personality, and that’s why the fans loved him.
“Most importantly, though, he was a brilliant person with a huge heart. He lit up any room he walked into, and that’s how he should be remembered.”"

“GE Vernova will supply and commission 40 units of its 2.7-132 onshore wind turbines for this 108 MW wind power project. With this order, GE recorded more than 3 GW of orders in India with its 2.7 MW turbine and anticipates crossing 5 GW of onshore wind installed base in the country by early 2024.” the company said.
Amplus Solar’s wind farm will be commissioned by August 2024 and will provide accessible, affordable, and reliable green energy to local businesses and consumers, it added.
Deepak Maloo, Regional Sales Leader for GE Vernova’s onshore wind business in Asia Pacific said, “GE has demonstrated expertise in India, having installed over 50 per cent of new wind capacity in the country last year. We are thankful to Amplus Solar for entrusting us with their first wind farm and look forward to furthering our partnership as the company continues to build its renewable energy portfolio under the leadership of Petronas.”
Amplus Solar CEO, Sharad Pungalia, said, “We are happy to have found an experienced partner GE Vernova as we take another step in contributing to the country’s net-zero targets with our first wind-power project. We are confident that together, we can create the synergies needed for the successful completion of this project.”
GE Vernova’s 2.7-132 wind turbine has proven to be the technology of choice for many customers in India due to its industry leading performance at India’s low wind speeds.
The project will leverage GE’s significant local footprint in India with product design primarily at GE’s technology centre in Bengaluru, turbines assembled at GE’s manufacturing facility in Pune and blades manufactured at LM Wind Power’s plant in Vadodara."

State Street (NYSE:STT) shareholders have endured a 13% loss from investing in the stock five years ago,2023-06-15T12:51:00.000000000+00:00,"In order to justify the effort of selecting individual stocks, it's worth striving to beat the returns from a market index fund. But even the best stock picker will only win with some selections. So we wouldn't blame long term State Street Corporation (NYSE:STT) shareholders for doubting their decision to hold, with the stock down 25% over a half decade. In contrast, the stock price has popped 9.8% in the last thirty days. However, this may be a matter of broader market optimism, since stocks are up 6.8% in the same time.
With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.
View our latest analysis for State Street
To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).
During the unfortunate half decade during which the share price slipped, State Street actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 6.1% per year. So it doesn't seem like EPS is a great guide to understanding how the market is valuing the stock. Alternatively, growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.
Because of the sharp contrast between the EPS growth rate and the share price growth, we're inclined to look to other metrics to understand the changing market sentiment around the stock.
Revenue is actually up 0.5% over the time period. A more detailed examination of the revenue and earnings may or may not explain why the share price languishes; there could be an opportunity.
The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).
State Street is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. You can see what analysts are predicting for State Street in this interactive graph of future profit estimates.
We're pleased to report that State Street shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 22% over one year. That's including the dividend. That certainly beats the loss of about 3% per year over the last half decade. The long term loss makes us cautious, but the short term TSR gain certainly hints at a brighter future.

Paytm FASTag user charged Rs 9 crore for NHAI toll!,2023-06-15T12:44:00.000000000+00:00,"New Delhi: A Paytm FASTag user recently reported that he was charged Rs 9 crore as NHAI toll at Mayar toll plaza near Hisar in Haryana. The user, who goes by profile name ‘gsratta’ on Team-bhp forum, said that he received a text message from Paytm stating that his Fastag has been blacklisted due to insufficient balance. When he checked the Paytm app, he saw that he had been charged Rs 9 crore whereas normal toll at the same toll plaza is Rs90.
“Today I received a text message from Paytm, that the Fastag of my vehicle has been blacklisted, due to insufficient balance, on checking in the Paytm application, I came to know that they had charged a whopping Nine crores ( yes that is true) see the attached screenshots. A popup came up to add ₹ 90000000/- to the Paytm wallet to continue using the fastag. Normal toll at the same toll plaza is ₹90. Contacted the helpline number, but it was not useful. How to proceed now. Please advise,” gsratta wrote on Team-bhp.
The user said that they contacted Paytm customer service, but they were unable to resolve the issue.

“The helpline automated system would not let me talk to a customer care person, instead it required me to raise the issue, in the Help & Support section of the Paytm Application. The result from the same was inconclusive. It doesn’t allow screenshots in the Help & Support section, so had to take pictures using another device,” he added.
Another Team-bhp member ‘Emvi’ meanwhile, shared a screenshot showing he was charged Rs 1.5 crore.
Both Emvi and gsratta, however, later confirmed in the forum that the issues were attributed to technical glitches and were subsequently resolved.
These were not first times for Paytm Fastag users to have been charged an exorbitant amount for toll. In 2022, a user was charged Rs 2 lakh for toll. Paytm had said that the charge was due to a technical error and had rectified the same.
Fastag is a prepaid toll collection system that uses radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. When a vehicle passes through a toll plaza, the RFID tag in the Fastag is read and the toll amount is deducted from the user’s account.
The Fastag system has been praised for its convenience and for reducing traffic congestion at toll plazas. However, the recent incidents have raised concerns about the reliability of the system. The NHAI and Paytm need to take steps to address these concerns and to ensure that the Fastag system is a reliable and convenient way to pay tolls.

Sony SAB launches digital campaign #HameshaKaHiKyun to promote its show ‘Vanshaj’,2023-06-15T12:44:00.000000000+00:00,"Sony SAB has launched a digital campaign #HameshaKaHiKyun for its new show ‘Vanshaj’. The campaign highlights the fact that only 15% of board members in Indian family businesses are women, and the percentage of women holding senior VP roles has decreased from 18% to 13%. The campaign aims to challenge gender stereotypes and advocate for inclusivity in leadership roles.
Sony SAB’s new family drama, ‘Vanshaj’ delves into the dynamics of a legacy business empire, challenging conventional patriarchal narratives. ‘Vanshaj’ aims to shatter the glass ceiling and emphasize that leadership and entrepreneurship should be determined by one’s abilities rather than gender.
“Sony SAB as a brand believes in real stories and real emotions, exploring new and more relevant themes that resonate with the lives of our viewers more closely. Vanshaj is one more forward-looking show from the channel which explores the challenges regarding inheritance even in today’s world. Using a sharp consumer insight helped us come up with a strong consumer campaign both for mass media and digital, riding on the understanding that most family-owned businesses often choose a male heir to take over the reins,” Vaishali Sharma, head of marketing, Sony SAB, said.
Since its launch, the campaign has gained traction by showcasing the lack of female representation in corporate leadership roles through a series of impactful videos. The success of the campaign reflects the growing desire for change and the need to amplify the voices of women leaders."

JetBlue introduces a new and blue standard livery: video,2023-06-15T12:35:49.000000000+00:00,"JetBlue has introduced a new standard livery for its aircraft, replacing the white-focused fuselages with an all-blue design.
The New York John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK)-based carrier revealed the new livery in a Twitter video, calling the new design a livery that got “a fresh bold look just like the moves we’ve been making as a travel company”.
In a separate press release, the airline explained that it has always “made big bold moves – and we’re matching those with a big bold update to our iconic liveries, with a blue allover fuselage, refreshed (and refreshing) accent colors, energized tailfin patterns that extend onto the body and belly, and more”.
According to JetBlue, the first aircraft to bear the new livery will be named “A Defining MoMint”. The Airbus A321, registered as N982JB, was delivered to the airline new in August 2017. Flightradar24.com data showed that the A321 was at Macon Middle Georgia Regional Airport (MCN), Georgia, United States (US) between May 29 and June 14, 2023, when it flew back to JFK.
Since then, the aircraft operated a round-trip itinerary to San Francisco International Airport (SFO), with another round-trip journey planned to SFO on June 15, 2023. Following the flight to SFO, however, the Airbus A321 is scheduled to fly to Las Vegas Harry Reid International Airport (LAS).
“Look for refreshed versions of our existing patterns to make their runway debuts as the rest of the fleet is repaint-ready,” concluded JetBlue.
Defining MoMint is equipped with 16 Mint suites, a “refreshing take on premium travel, plus a Core experience that’s tech-forward and trek-friendly, and a fully-stocked grab-and-go Pantry,” as described by the airline.
Previously, the aircraft was known as “One Mint, Two Mint, Blue Mint, You Mint”.
In total, JetBlue has 34 Airbus A321s equipped with Mint Suites, while another 28 A321s are configured in an all-economy 200-seat configuration."

Premier League debutants Luton will play their first top-flight fixture since 1992 away to Roberto De Zerbi’s Brighton on Saturday, August 12, having to wait until the following weekend for their first home game when Kenilworth Road will become the smallest ground to host a fixture in the competition for the visit of Burnley.
The other promoted side Sheffield United kick off their season with a home game against Crystal Palace.
The outstanding fixture of the opening weekend will be at Stamford Bridge where Mauricio Pochettino begins life as Chelsea manager against Liverpool on Sunday, August 13, with both sides looking to bounce back after disappointing campaigns.

Ex-Flipkart senior executive Goteti starts up again with travel fintech Scapia,2023-06-15T12:31:00.000000000+00:00,"Flipkart veteran Anil Goteti has embarked on a fintech venture. Scapia, which features a credit card and an app, allows customers to earn points earned on card spends to be redeemed for flights and hotel stays worldwide.
The card, introduced in partnership with Federal Bank and based on the VISA network, can be used in over 150 countries across a million merchants, enabling users to access transactions in real-time within the Scapia app.
“Scapia aims to rewrite the narrative by offering 10% rewards on every transaction, minting these rewards into Scapia coins,” the company said in a statement. “These coins then become your ticket to the world, redeemable for flights and hotel stays across the globe, with a user-friendly, one-click redemption on the Scapia app.”
The card also offers travel benefits like zero forex markup, unlimited domestic lounge access with zero joining and annual fees.
“Scapia is more than a credit card. It's a commitment to making travel accessible for everyone who dreams of seeing the world. It's a new way to reward young Indian travellers,” Goteti, who was earlier a senior vice president at Flipkart, said.
Scapia, which has been in stealth mode for over a year, is Goteti’s second independent foray in the startup space. ET in January 2022 reported that Goteti’s earlier venture, Protonn, shut its business and returned over $9 million to investors, which included the likes of Matrix Partners and Flipkart cofounder Binny Bansal.
Goteti, who headed some of Flipkart’s key businesses such as mobile, home and furniture categories, quit the e-commerce firm in November 2020 after an eight-year stint and set up Protonn the following year. The company, however, could not find the right product-market fit and the founders did not agree to pivot its business model.

Manchester United competing with Chelsea for Inter’s André Onana,2023-06-15T12:29:46.000000000+00:00,"Chelsea face competition from Manchester United for the signing of the Internazionale goalkeeper André Onana. United have also shortlisted Porto’s Diogo Costa as they target a challenger to David de Gea.
De Gea is out of contract this summer and yet to finalise a new deal. The Spaniard has been one of United’s best players since joining in 2011 but was inconsistent last season and Erik ten Hag wants to bring in a goalkeeper.
United are weighing up their next move after becoming discouraged in their pursuit of Tottenham’s Harry Kane. Signing a top striker is a priority for Ten Hag but Spurs do not want to sell Kane and Napoli’s asking price for Victor Osimhen is prohibitive. Atalanta’s Rasmus Højlund is a target, but the Dane is one for the future.
United must also decide whether to improve their offer for the Chelsea midfielder Mason Mount, after having an opening bid of £40m turned down. They could decide to spend heavily on a goalkeeper if they cannot sign a world-class No 9.
De Gea was at fault for Manchester City’s winner in the FA Cup final and his unconvincing distribution has raised doubts over whether the 32-year-old is suited to Ten Hag’s football. Chelsea and United have registered an interest in Onana with Inter, whose financial problems could force them to sell. It is believed the Cameroon international would favour a move to United. Costa is an alternative target for Ten Hag. The 23-year-old is highly rated and a Portugal international.
Onana is excellent with the ball at his feet and impressed during Inter’s run to the Champions League final, where they were beaten 1-0 by Manchester City. Inter fear they will lose Onana and have inquired about Brentford’s David Raya, who is wanted by Tottenham.
Signing Onana would fix a problem area for Chelsea, who will listen to offers for Kepa Arrizabalaga and Édouard Mendy. Arrizabalaga’s high wages could make him harder to sell than Mendy, who lost his place to the Spaniard last season. Chelsea have also targeted Milan’s Mike Maignan and Valencia’s Giorgi Mamardashvili.
Chelsea have held talks with Inter over a number of issues this week. Along with discussing Onana, Inter have explored signing Kalidou Koulibaly and Romelu Lukaku on loan. Chelsea need to raise funds and would prefer to sell Koulibaly and Lukaku.
Chelsea want £70m plus add-ons for Mount. They are expected to sell Mateo Kovacic to Manchester City and want £70m for Kai Havertz, who is a target for Arsenal."

Coinbase Announces Repurchase of 0.50% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2026,2023-06-15T12:20:00.000000000+00:00,"Coinbase Announces Repurchase of 0.50% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2026
Repurchasing $64.5 million of convertible senior notes at approximately 29% discount to par value
On June 14, 2023, Coinbase Global, Inc. (the “Company” or “Coinbase”) entered into separate, privately negotiated purchase agreements with a limited number of holders of its 0.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the “Notes”) to repurchase (the “Repurchases”) $64.5 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes. The Company estimates that it will expend approximately $45.5 million in cash to consummate the Repurchases. The transaction represents an approximately 29% discount to par value.
The Company previously entered into capped call transactions with certain financial institutions in connection with the initial issuance of the Notes. All of these transactions are expected to remain in effect notwithstanding the Repurchases.
The Repurchases are expected to close on or about June 20, 2023, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Following such closings, approximately $1.373 billion principal amount of the Notes will remain outstanding.
“We are always looking for the best opportunities to deploy capital to create shareholder value,” said Alesia Haas, Chief Financial Officer of Coinbase. “As we stated in our most recent shareholder letter, the first quarter of 2023 was a turning point in building a company that is more efficient and financially disciplined. This opportunistic repurchase is a continuation of those efforts and reflects our confidence in our business, strong first quarter financial performance, and improved competitive positioning. We have reduced our 2026 convertible senior notes outstanding and we will look for additional such opportunities in the future.”

"Uber Closes Delivery Business in Italy, Mobility Business in Israel",2023-06-15T12:19:00.000000000+00:00,"Uber Technologies is discontinuing its Uber Eats delivery business in Italy as well as its eponymous mobility business in Israel as Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi seeks to focus on markets where the group can be the first or second largest player.

UPDATE 2-Delta Air Lines resumes dividend suspended in 2020 during pandemic,2023-06-15T12:15:00.000000000+00:00,"(Adds Southwest action, more detail on Delta dividend)
June 15 (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines said on Thursday it would pay a quarterly dividend, resuming a payout that the carrier had suspended in March 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The dividend, of $0.10 per share, will be paid on Aug. 7 to shareholders of record as of the close of business July 17, the U.S. airline said.
In December, Southwest Airlines became the first major U.S. airline to reinstate its quarterly dividend, more than two years after suspending it in the wake of the pandemic.
The resumption of Delta's payout reflects its progress on its three-year financial plan, the airline said, including more than $10 billion of debt repayment over the last two years.
The move comes as Delta forecast that strong summer travel demand will result in higher-than-expected profit for the quarter through June.
As a condition of receiving $54 billion government assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic, airlines were prohibited from paying dividends or repurchasing stock.
Those restrictions expired last fall. Delta Air Lines received $11.9 billion in U.S. assistance.
In March 2020, Delta paid a $0.4025 share dividend, which was its 27th consecutive dividend at the time. (Reporting by Aishwarya Nair in Bengaluru and David Shepardson in Washington; Editing by Savio D'Souza and Alexander Smith)"

Real Madrid or Inter could give Man City fixture nightmare in Premier League and Champions League,2023-06-15T12:14:00.000000000+00:00,"Manchester City's fixture list for 2023/24 has thrown up plenty of nuances, with extremely difficult runs of games in October and March.
From October, City face Arsenal, Brighton, Manchester United, Chelsea, Liverpool and Tottenham in the space of seven Premier League fixtures, and the same group of games are reversed in the Spring.
In March, City will play United, Liverpool, Brighton and Arsenal all in a row, and around key Champions League fixtures to make the task even more difficult.
With six Champions League group games before Christmas, the fixture computer has thrown up some potentially difficult weeks where City are in European action either side of games that could turn out to be crucial in the league.
ALSO READ: Pep Guardiola's most feared fixture will come at the worst time for Man City treble defence
The Champions League group stage kicks off on September 19/20, in between a trip to West Ham and a home fixture with Nottingham Forest.
The second matchday of the group stage comes on October 3 or 4 after a trip to Wolves and before an eagerly-anticipated clash with Arsenal at the Etihad.
Later in October, City host Brighton, then play their next Champions League fixture on October 24 or 25, before travelling to Manchester United for the first derby of the season.
The matchday four fixtures are on November 7 or 8, and come in between a home clash with Bournemouth and a potentially tricky trip to Chelsea.
After the November international break, City welcome Liverpool in the Premier League, face a crucial matchday five on November 28 or 29 in Europe, and then host Tottenham immediately afterwards.
The final matchday - where City will hope to have secured qualification - comes between a first trip to Kenilworth Road to take on Luton, and a home meeting with Crystal Palace.
City are guaranteed a place in Pot One in the Champions League after winning the competition but could face Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid, Inter Milan, Borussia Dortmund, RB Leipzig or Porto from Pot Two. Selected other teams across Pots Three and Four include AC Milan, Real Sociedad and Celtic.
That means City could face a run of fixtures like Liverpool at home, Real Madrid away, and Tottenham at home - or Brighton at home, Inter Milan away, and Manchester United away.
Assuming City qualify for the last-16, the first leg could take place on one of two midweeks in February. Either it could be played in between Premier League home fixtures against Everton and Chelsea, or it could be played between the Chelsea game and a trip to Bournemouth.
The second leg will be played in the middle of a difficult March fixture list, either between United at home and Liverpool away, or between Liverpool away and Brighton away.
Should City progress to the quarter-finals, the first leg will come after the trip to Crystal Palace and before the visit of Luton. The second leg, a week later, will be played before the ever-difficult trip to Tottenham. However, should City or Spurs reach the FA Cup semi-finals, that would likely cause the Premier League game to be rearranged.
On to the potential semi-finals, and City face Nottingham Forest away before the first legs on April 30 or May 1. Then Wolves visit City at the weekend, before the second leg on May 7 or 8, and then a tricky trip to Fulham.

As we move through NFL mandatory minicamps this month and gear up for the start of 2023 training camps at the end of July, a handful of big-name players are amid negotiations for new contracts. So we checked in around the league on where things stand for 19 stars who could get paid this summer.
Could Justin Herbert and Joe Burrow reset the quarterback market after Jalen Hurts signed a $255 million extension in April and Lamar Jackson re-upped with Baltimore for $260 million over five years?

"Stellantis to close Illinois assembly plant, lay off workers",2023-06-15T12:11:38.000000000+00:00,"This is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated. Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.
BELVIDERE, Ill. (AP) — Hundreds of workers are expected to be laid off when automaker Stellantis closes an assembly plant in northern Illinois early next year, citing the challenge of rising costs related to the electric vehicle market and other factors.
Stellantis said Friday that its Belvidere Assembly Plant will be idled effective Feb. 28 as the company “considers other avenues to optimize operations.”
“This difficult but necessary action will result in indefinite layoffs, which are expected to exceed six months,” Stellantis said in a statement, adding that notices have been sent to hourly and salaried workers.
About 1,350 people are employed at the plant, which produces the Jeep Cherokee. Belvidere is about 70 miles (112 kilometers) northwest of Chicago.
“The company will make every effort to place indefinitely laid off employees in open full-time positions as they become available,” it said.
Stellantis was formed last year with the merger of Fiat Chrysler and France’s PSA Peugeot.
Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s administration has assembled a response team from the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity to help displaced workers find new employment, said Pritzker spokesperson Jordan Abudeyyeh.
She said the administration will work with local elected officials, community colleges and others to ensure appropriate retraining programs are available, and with Stellantis to find new uses for the Belvidere plant.
In 2016, then-Fiat Chrysler announced it would invest $350 million in the plant to produce the Jeep Cherokee. Production on the Cherokee began there in 2017.
Stellantis said Friday that the automaker is not commenting on the future of the “Cherokee nameplate.”
“This is an important vehicle in the lineup, and we remain committed long term to this mid-size SUV segment,” company spokesperson Jodi Tinson said in an email.
Stellantis, which also pointed to the coronavirus pandemic and global microchip shortage as challenges to the auto industry, said it is working to identify opportunities to repurpose the Belvidere facility."
Tesla short sellers are down billions after stock's winning streak,2023-06-15T12:11:00.000000000+00:00,"It's been an 'unprofitable trade' for Tesla shorts so far, analyst says
Tesla Inc. stock took a breather on Wednesday, snapping a 13-day winning streak, but it has more than doubled so far this year, creating a multibillion-dollar headache for those betting that the shares would fall.
There has been an increase in Tesla (TSLA) short selling for all of 2023, but ""we've recently seen short covering as its stock price has been rallying,"" said Ihor Dusaniwsky, a managing director at financial analytics firm S3 Partners. ""This has been a very unprofitable trade for Tesla short sellers.""
Tesla shares on Tuesday ended at their highest since late September after gaining for 13 straight sessions.
Real-time short-interest data from S3 Partners shows that Tesla shorts were down about $816 million in mark-to-market losses based on Tuesday's 3.5% jump for the stock.
Shorts have lost $12.68 billion in year-to-date mark-to-market losses, down 80%; they are down $5.05 billion, or 24%, so far in June. They had $15.85 billion in mark-to-market profits in 2022.

""With [Tesla's] stock price continuing its recent upward trend we should see continued short covering as the [Tesla] short squeeze tightens its hold on short sellers, especially those with less conviction,"" Dusaniwsky said.
After a difficult April, when it fell 20%, Tesla stock was on a tear in May, and has kept that up in June, gaining about 60% in the period. For the year, the stock has gained 110%, which compares with an advance of about 14% for the S&P 500 index.
The most recent gains for the stock came as Tesla saw its fast-charging standard becoming the de facto standard in the U.S.
Last week, Tesla and General Motors Co. announced that GM EV owners would have access to Tesla's ""Supercharger"" network, usually located near major highways.
GM also said that its future EVs would conform to the Tesla-developed North America Charging Standard, or NACS, by 2025, and before that the automaker would offer an adapter. That follows a similar move by Ford Motor Co. last month
Tesla CEO Elon Musk said back in July 2021 that he would open Tesla's Supercharger to other EVs, although he promised that would happen by the end of 2021.
Tesla created its own connector because there were no standards when it became the only maker of long-range EVs, Musk said then.
Other EVs began to be allowed to charge at Tesla's fast-charging stations last year, but the GM (GM) and Ford (F) announcements brought the matter to the forefront.
GM, Ford and other automakers currently use the Combined Charging System, or CCS, as their charging connection, which is standard in most EVs in Europe and other regions. Tesla has made NACS open source, which means more products that use it are hitting the market.

"Uber to shut food delivery business in Italy, exit Israel",2023-06-15T12:10:00.000000000+00:00,"Uber said on Thursday it will shut its food delivery business in Italy and exit Israel, where it has not built sufficient market share.
The moves were ""in line with our efforts to focus on markets where we have opportunities for sustainable growth"", a company spokesperson said.
CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has said Uber will invest only in markets where it can be the largest or second largest player.
Uber trails Just Eat and Glovo in Italian food delivery, and Gett Taxi and Yango in the Israeli taxi and private hire market.
The company, which relies on self-employed contractors for its delivery service, said around 50 Uber employees and thousands of non-employee couriers and restaurants would be affected in Italy.

Manchester United eyeing shock move for Leeds defender Robin Koch,2023-06-15T12:09:00.000000000+00:00,"Robin Koch has emerged as a shock target for Manchester United, who have him on their shortlist for defensive reinforcements this summer, according to reports in Germany.
The versatile defender has been with Leeds since signing from Freiburg in 2020, making 73 Premier League appearances over three seasons before the Yorkshire side were relegated to the Championship.
The Germany international is not expected to continue with the club in the second tier, although Manchester United are a somewhat unexpected interested party.
However, Sky Sport Germany’s Florian Plettenberg reports that Koch is indeed on the Red Devils’ shortlist and ‘loose talks’ have even taken place over a move.
Koch’s contract at Elland Road expires next year so the club will likely be happy to cash in on him while they can, with the likes of Newcastle and Arsenal also reported to hold an interest in him.
The 26-year-old did state in March that there had been initial discussions over a new deal with Leeds, although nothing has been signed and that was before they were relegated from the top flight.
‘During the season, I want to distract myself as little as possible with future planning,’ he told German outlet Spox three months ago. ‘Initial talks are currently underway between the club and my agent.
‘Towards the end of the season, and during the summer break, I will deal with it. Now, my focus is 100 per cent on our games and goals.’
Koch has won eight caps for Germany and offers some versatility as he can play in central midfield as well as his usual position of centre-back.
Leeds paid £13m for him in 2020 and despite now being in the Championship, they would expect to make a profit on that with huge Premier League clubs interested in him.

"India's debt burden likely to decline, key determinant of fiscal strength will be affordability: Moody's",2023-06-15T12:05:00.000000000+00:00,"Moody's Investors Service on Thursday said the key determinant of India's fiscal strength and the credit profile will be debt affordability and projected a downward trend for the debt burden. ""As long as nominal GDP growth holds, India's debt burden will be stable or decline slightly,"" Moody's said.
In a report, it said India's fast-growing GDP, which is estimated to average 11 per cent in nominal terms, is a key driver of the projections of a downward trend in the country's debt burden.
""As in the past, the key determinant of fiscal strength and the credit profile will be debt affordability and in particular the proportion of revenue absorbed by interest payments,"" Moody's said.
India has a relatively high level of general government debt, estimated at around 81.8 per cent of GDP for 2022-23, compared with the Baa-rated median of around 56 per cent.
The country also has a low debt affordability, in terms of general government interest payments as a percentage of revenues, which for India is estimated at 26 per cent for 2022-23, compared with the Baa median of around 8.4 per cent.
""At 26 per cent currently, it is a large proportion, which, if not further addressed via a continued broadening of the revenue base, will remain an important constraint on the government's ability to provide more support for growth and address developmental needs,"" Moody's added.
Moody's has a 'Baa3' sovereign credit rating on India, with stable outlook. Baa3 is the lowest investment grade rating.
On Friday, Moody's is scheduled to meet Indian government officials during which the latter is likely to make a strong pitch for a sovereign rating upgrade."
3 reasons why we’re really excited about the Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds,2023-06-15T12:03:03.000000000+00:00,"More details have just dropped about the Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds. The successor to Sony’s best true wireless earbuds has been the subject of several leaks in recent weeks – one of which revealed great news for those with smaller ears. Further details have also been found in a leaked spec sheet.
And now there’s a newer, better leak via WinFuture.de that includes what appear to be promotional images (above) and more details about what the new earbuds will offer. And it looks like they’re going to be pretty special.
Here are three reasons why we’re excited about the Sony WF-1000XM5.
1. You don’t need to have a massive head
For all their many joys, the Sony WF-1000XM4 earbuds are hefty both in terms of dimensions and in weight. But the new 1000XM5 buds are significantly smaller and a lot lighter too. Each earbud is reportedly 1.4g lighter than before, bringing the weight down to 5.9g per earbud, and the case is 2g lighter too. The case doesn’t really matter to me, but as someone who’s worn larger earbuds for long periods I’m all in favour of smaller and lighter.
2. They’re probably going to sound better
A slimmer design means new drivers, and the latest reports say that the new drivers here are Dynamic Driver X with a diameter of 8.4mm. They’ll be accompanied by two new proprietary chips to support Hi-Res Audio and Sony’s DSEE Extreme audio tech and promise better microphones too.
3. They’re getting an extra battery
WinFuture reports that there’s an additional battery in the WF-1000XM5 case, which extends the total running time of the earbuds to 24 hours and gives you an hour of playback from just three minutes of charge. A full charge takes two hours.
How much will Sony’s WF-1000XM5 cost?
Those are the big three reasons, but there’s more. Bluetooth 5.3 with multi-point should make it easy to connect to all your kit, and the buds are IPX4 certified for water and sweat so they should be a good option for runners and gym-goers.
We don’t yet know when these buds will go on sale or what their price tag will be, but we’ll be very surprised if they’re not priced similarly to the current model, which retails for $279.99 / £250 / AU$449.95.
If you can’t wait for the Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds to drop and need some new headphones for the summer, then take a look at our guide of the best earbuds, which features other Sony earbuds worth considering.

Those who invested in Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) three years ago are up 25%,2023-06-15T12:02:00.000000000+00:00,"Low-cost index funds make it easy to achieve average market returns. But if you invest in individual stocks, some are likely to underperform. For example, the Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) share price return of 16% over three years lags the market return in the same period. Unfortunately, the share price has fallen 8.6% over twelve months.
Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns.
Check out our latest analysis for Bank of America
While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.
Bank of America was able to grow its EPS at 11% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. This EPS growth is higher than the 5% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems investors have become more cautious about the company, over time. We'd venture the lowish P/E ratio of 8.57 also reflects the negative sentiment around the stock.
The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).
It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Bank of America's earnings, revenue and cash flow.
What About Dividends?
When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Bank of America the TSR over the last 3 years was 25%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.
Bank of America shareholders are down 6.1% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 20%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 2% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk. , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.

KLA's (NASDAQ:KLAC) investors will be pleased with their incredible 376% return over the last five years,2023-06-15T12:02:00.000000000+00:00,"We think all investors should try to buy and hold high quality multi-year winners. And we've seen some truly amazing gains over the years. For example, the KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) share price is up a whopping 336% in the last half decade, a handsome return for long term holders. And this is just one example of the epic gains achieved by some long term investors. Also pleasing for shareholders was the 24% gain in the last three months. But this could be related to the strong market, which is up 11% in the last three months.
With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.
Check out our latest analysis for KLA
While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.
Over half a decade, KLA managed to grow its earnings per share at 41% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 34% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.
The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).

What About Dividends?
When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for KLA the TSR over the last 5 years was 376%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.
It's nice to see that KLA shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 57% over the last year. That's including the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 37% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand KLA better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks, for example - KLA has we think you should be aware of.

Investors in CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) have unfortunately lost 6.2% over the last year,2023-06-15T12:01:00.000000000+00:00,"It's easy to match the overall market return by buying an index fund. But if you buy individual stocks, you can do both better or worse than that. Unfortunately the CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) share price slid 11% over twelve months. That contrasts poorly with the market return of 20%. On the other hand, the stock is actually up 2.9% over three years.
Since shareholders are down over the longer term, lets look at the underlying fundamentals over the that time and see if they've been consistent with returns.
View our latest analysis for CME Group
To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.
During the unfortunate twelve months during which the CME Group share price fell, it actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 2.9%. It could be that the share price was previously over-hyped.
By glancing at these numbers, we'd posit that the the market had expectations of much higher growth, last year. But other metrics might shed some light on why the share price is down.
CME Group's dividend seems healthy to us, so we doubt that the yield is a concern for the market. From what we can see, revenue is pretty flat, so that doesn't really explain the share price drop. Unless, of course, the market was expecting a revenue uptick.

We like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. So we recommend checking out this free report showing consensus forecasts
What About Dividends?
It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, CME Group's TSR for the last 1 year was -6.2%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!
CME Group shareholders are down 6.2% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 20%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 5% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand CME Group better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks, for example - CME Group has we think you should be aware of.
CME Group is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find this

AbbVie announces European Commission approval of Rinvoq® for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease,2023-06-15T12:00:54.000000000+00:00,"RINVOQ® is the first and only oral JAK inhibitor approved to treat Crohn’s disease in Europe
AbbVie, a US-based pharmaceutical company, has announced that its oral Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitor, RINVOQ® (upadacitinib), has been approved by the European Commission for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease in adult patients who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to conventional therapy or a biologic agent.
This marks the seventh indication for upadacitinib in the European Union, and the first and only oral JAK inhibitor approved to treat Crohn’s disease.
The European Commission approval is supported by data from two induction studies, U-EXCEED and U-EXCEL, and the U-ENDURE maintenance study. Statistical significance was achieved for the co-primary endpoints and key secondary endpoints with upadacitinib 45mg in the induction studies and upadacitinib 15mg and 30mg in the maintenance study compared to placebo.
A significantly higher proportion of patients treated with upadacitinib achieved the co-primary endpoints of endoscopic response and clinical remission and the key secondary endpoint of corticosteroid-free clinical remission at weeks 12 and 52 compared to placebo.
Safety results in Crohn’s disease were generally consistent with the known safety profile of upadacitinib
Upadacitinib is approved in the EU for the treatment of adults with radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, as well as adults and adolescents with atopic dermatitis.
Laurent Peyrin-Biroulet, MD, PhD, professor of gastroenterology and head of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease group at the Gastroenterology Department, University Hospital of Nancy, France, said: “These studies demonstrated upadacitinib’s ability to achieve key treatment targets, including endoscopic outcomes and symptomatic relief, that are critical for patients and beneficial for long-term care.”"
Only Connect host points out similarities to fresh New York Times game,2023-06-15T12:00:27.000000000+00:00,"The New York Times is beta testing a game called Connections which has gained attention for its similarities to a round featured in BBC2 quiz show Only Connect.
In both games, players are shown 16 clues which must be categorised into four groups of four. Once a category is correctly identified, the clues are grouped together at the top of the board and asasigned a colour.
The only notable difference is that Connections refreshes each day and players can only make four mistakes (akin to Wordle), whilst in the Connecting Wall (as it's known on Only Connect) players must solve the wall in two and a half minutes. Connecting Wall players have unlimited guesses until they've found two categories, after which they are only given three incorrect attempts.
Watch on YouTube
The similarities did not escape the notice of Only Connect viewers or host Victoria Coren Mitchell.
Coren Mitchell responded to New York Times puzzles editor Wyna Liu on Twitter, asking Liu ""do you know this has been a TV show in the UK since 2008?! It's so similar I guess you must do?""

Baltimore Ravens Sign 2023 NFL First-Round Pick To Improve Offensive Plays Next Season,2023-06-15T12:00:00.000000000+00:00,"KEY POINTS
The Ravens have added another wide receiver after coming to terms with Zay Flowers
Flowers' signing means the Ravens have signed all their 2023 NFL Draft picks
Odell Beckham Jr. continues to work his way back with Ravens
The Baltimore Ravens have wrapped up their offseason program, highlighted by the signing of 2023 NFL Draft pick Zay Flowers.
According to Adam Schefter of ESPN, the Ravens have come to terms with the former Boston College product on Wednesday, June 14.
The scribe reported that per the player's agents, Eric Dunn and Matt Leist of Loyalty Above All (LAA), Flowers agreed to a four-year, $14 million guaranteed contract that included a $7.2 million signing bonus that will be paid this year.
Flowers was the third wide receiver off the board following successive picks of four wide receivers.
Looking ahead, the 22-year-old player is expected to provide the Ravens with a huge boost on the offensive end under the watch of coordinator Todd Monken.
The Florida native is described as a quick and elusive wide receiver.
Last season with Boston College, Flowers caught 78 passes last season with Boston College for 1,077 yards and 12 touchdowns.
With this, he has been compared to former Ravens wide receiver Steve Smith.

The Ravens held their last mandatory camp on Thursday, June 15. Training will officially start in late July.
The official signing of Flowers comes not long after Beckham made his debut at minicamp.
The one-time Super Bowl champion got back into the field for the first time after nearly 16 months.
Although it wasn't that pretty, it was a meaningful one to the wide receiver.
That included catching a pass from Lamar Jackson after he playfully did some pushups after slipping, which resulted in limited practice.

Audi chief sets sights on China in electric car catch-up,2023-06-15T11:59:49.000000000+00:00,"INGOLSTADT, Germany :Audi has to speed up development of new models to meet a surge in demand for electric vehicles, especially in China, the German luxury carmaker's CEO said in an interview with Reuters published on Thursday.
""We are in the process of reviewing our entire development process,"" Markus Duesmann said.
Advertisement
The company needs new and shorter production cycles for the areas of connectivity and software. ""And we are also looking more intensively at how this is done in China,"" Duesmann said.
""I expect that over time we will get close to a development time of 30 months,"" he added. That compares with a current time of more like 48 months.
The Volkswagen subsidiary has lagged behind fellow German carmakers BMW and Mercedes-Benz in the pivot towards battery-electric vehicles (BEV).
""In 2030, the BEV share of the premium car market should already be between 60 and 70 per cent, depending on the region,"" Duesmann said. ""We have to react when a market suddenly changes so quickly.""
That shift could happen even sooner in China, but Audi's sales performance in the world's biggest car market has fallen short of expectations. The reason, Duesmann said, is that ""we still don't have the optimal vehicles on the market for Chinese needs"".
Advertisement
From January to March, Audi sold just over 3,000 electric cars in China.
Local heavyweight BYD, meanwhile, overtook the VW brand in the first quarter to become China's top marque with a total market share of 11 per cent, including traditional combustion-engine cars.
SOFTWARE DELAYS
Unlike BMW and Mercedes, Audi has not brought out any major additions to its model range over the past two years.
The new Q6 e-tron has been delayed by behind-schedule software development.
Advertisement
Its release, now set for the end of the year, marks the launch of a product offensive, with Audi aiming to bring more than 20 new models onto the market by 2025, half of them powered by electric motors.
From 2026, Audi doesn't plan any new combustion-engine models.
Hoping to offset any disappointment in China, Duesmann said the carmaker wanted to strengthen its business in North America, tapping into a strong U.S. car market and Washington's generous subsidies programme.
Audi's strategy ""has been reinforced by the Inflation Reduction Act"", the CEO said, referring to the programme.
Audi has a plant in Mexico and is currently considering an expansion of its production capacity in the region, perhaps at VW's site in Tennessee.

A decision on this will ""definitely be made this year,"" Duesmann said."

$10 trillion asset manager and top banks are betting big on Bitcoin (BTC)
Blue-chip banks and corporations are increasing their bets on Bitcoin (BTC) by purchasing MicroStrategy (MSTR) stocks. In recent months, they injected a massive amount of liquidity in MSTR, Bitcoin Culture newsletter reports.
Their authors tracked the activity of two heavyweight asset management firms, BlackRock and Fidelity, plus Bank of America, in terms of their exposure to MSTR, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin (BTC).
For corporations that are not interested (or limited) in buying Bitcoin (BTC) directly, MSTR shares usually serve as a reliable proxy investment to get exposure to Bitcoin (BTC) price performance.
That said, both BlackRock and Fidelity are in the top five of MSTR stock owners. As reported by CNN, in recent months, Fidelity increased its exposure to MSTR more than sevenfold.
Bank of America also increased its MSTR share through BofA Securities Inc. Its stake size spiked by over 47,000%, as displayed by Bitcoin Culture.
Largely, institutions are underwater at current Bitcoin (BTC) prices
Also, MSTR stocks are aggressively accumulated by the largest Canada banks and investment platforms from all over the globe.

Fixed income trading will drop 15% to 20% compared with the bumper quarter a year earlier, Chief Financial Officer James von Moltke said Thursday. Analysts were expecting a decline of about 12%.
“We are seeing the trail-off in macro, but actually still quite encouraging activity despite all the things we’ve been through - debt ceiling and what have you,” von Moltke said at an investor conference hosted by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in Paris. “But compared to this outstanding” period last year, “we’re naturally going to have a step-back.”
The German lender’s shares extended losses after the comments, falling as much as 2.4% in Frankfurt trading.
Deutsche Bank joins Wall Street firms in flagging weaker debt trading, as interest rates near their peak and the economy is likely to enter a recession. JPMorgan Chase & Co. expects revenue from investment banking and trading to each decline 15% from a year ago, and Goldman Sachs has warned of a slump in trading that could exceed 25%. Bank of America Corp. expects its traders to be roughly flat.
A drop of as much as 20% would continue a trend that started in the first quarter, when Deutsche Bank reported 17% lower fixed income revenue. The lender in April announced plans to cut about 800 senior back-office staff as Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing steps up cost reductions in response.
The trading slowdown is driven by weaker demand for products that allow investors to bet on interest rate or foreign exchange movements, von Moltke said. Overall, however, the environment for banking isn’t all bad, he said, with asset prices holding up."

These sponsors diluted their stake through an initial public offering (IPO) in 2020 by selling 38,987,081 shares for Rs 2,100 crore. The entire proceeds of the offer went to all the promoters, including T Rowe Price.
The IPO came after the markets regulator Sebi order dated December 6, 2019, directing LIC, SBI and BoB to reduce their stake by December 2020, failing which, the regulator would freeze their excess voting rights.
Last year, PNB received government approval to divest its entire stake in UTI Asset Management Company Limited as part of its non-core asset sale plan to shore up its capital base.
DIPAM, last year, allowed Public Sector Enterprises (PSEs) wanting to divest stake in their subsidiaries to submit the proposal to their respective administrative ministries.
Earlier, the sale of majority or minority stakes in subsidiaries or units of PSEs was undertaken by the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM).
After the Cabinet in June allowed PSEs to decide and implement stake sales in their subsidiaries, the DIPAM on Thursday laid down guiding principles for strategic disinvestment/minority stake sale of PSE subsidiaries/units or their joint ventures.
As per the guidelines, the board of holding/parent PSE would recommend strategic disinvestment/minority stake sale of its subsidiaries/units/JVs to the administrative department, which would examine the proposal and send it to DIPAM.
DIPAM would then seek 'in-principle' approval of the Alternative Mechanism (AM) on disinvestment, chaired by the Union Finance Minister.
The decision of the AM would be communicated to the parent public sector enterprise, following which its board would undertake the transaction.
UTI Mutual Fund was created in 1964 after Parliament passed the Unit Trust of India (Transfer of Undertaking & Repeal) Act in 2002 after the flagship US-64 scheme went bankrupt. Post the Act, the then mighty UTI was bifurcated into Specified Undertaking of Unit Trust of India (Suuti), which owns almost 11.8 per cent of Axis Bank and UTI Asset Management Company.
The Baltimore-based T Rowe Price picked up 26 per cent in UTI in November 2009 by buying a 6.5 per cent stake each from the four promoters for USD 140 million."

MLB DFS Fantasy picks to make today
Marcus Stroman gets to continue his magical season for the Chicago Cubs against the Pittsburgh Pirates today. He's sporting a 2.42 ERA and the Pirates likely won't change that very much. He's a safe MLB DFS Fantasy pick.
The potential AL Cy Young in Nathan Eovaldi is on the bump for the Texas Rangers. While the Los Angeles Angels boast a red hot Shohei Ohtani, Eovaldi should pitch well once again.
Cristian Javier is 7-1 with a 3.13 ERA this season for the Houston Astros. Those numbers will probably get even better against the lowly Washington Nationals.

Reliance in talks for $2 billion loan to fuel expansion,2023-06-15T11:47:00.000000000+00:00,"Reliance Industries Ltd. is in talks with lenders for a foreign-currency loan of up to $2 billion to fuel the ongoing expansion of its oil-to-telecoms business, according to people familiar with the matter.
The sprawling firm, controlled by Asia’s richest man Mukesh Ambani, plans to use India’s dedicated external commercial borrowing route to secure the loan, the people said, asking not to be identified because the discussions are private.
The facility may have a maturity period ranging between three to five years, one of the people said, and the proceeds will be used for capital expenditure and to refinance another loan that matures in September.
Lenders involved in the discussions include Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and Standard Chartered Plc, one of the people said. Spokespeople for those banks declined to comment, while a representative for Reliance said they couldn’t immediately comment.
Ambani is raising funds as he continues to build out the telecoms and consumer-facing arms of an empire based on a bedrock of crude-oil refining. Reliance’s expansion spree has been fueled by generous borrowings after the firm managed to achieve net debt zero status in 2020.
Reliance has said it aims to invest $75 billion in renewable energy over 15 years and last year acquired the $3 billion streaming rights to the highly coveted Indian Premier League cricket tournament. The firm is also rolling out 5G network services across the South Asian nation, which is expected to cost $25 billion.

This 32-inch 1440p LG monitor is just £229 from Overclockers,2023-06-15T11:43:32.000000000+00:00,"Another day....another solid monitor deal. This time it's from Overclockers on an LG monitor, the 32GN600-B to be exact. If you're wanitng a larger gaming monitor to play on with a good spec list, this is available from Overclockers for just £229. which seems like a great deal.
Get the LG 32GN600-B for £229 from Overclockers (was £279)
A 2560x1440 resolution screen makes this LG panel immediately a great fit for a mid-range gaming PC or laptop. Moreover, you're getting a VA panel here, with all of the benefits to contrast that provides, as well as a 165Hz refresh rate and FreeSync Premium support to offer a smoother output without any tears or juddering. The fact also remains that you're getting a larger 32-inch screen, giving you more screen real estate to take advantage of, making this an excellent choice for more cinematic titles. The 165Hz refresh rate offered makes the 32GN600-B a fantastic choice for more competitive titles where you'll really feel the benefits of smoother and faster motion, although the chances are that you'll also generally notice a silkier experience even on the Windows desktop and in other titles, too.
This particular LG monitor also comes with a solid 350 nits of brightness, as well as a 3000:1 contrast ratio, aiding performance in darker scenes. A quoted colour space coverage of 95 percent of the sRGB colour space makes the monitor a reasonable choice for content creation too, as well as offering up HDR10, to accentuate detail in darker scenes, in theory at least. With this in mind, the 350 nits of brightness this LG monitor offers isn't enough to really take advantage of the powers of HDR. The monitor has both DisplayPort and HDMI outputs, suitable for a wide range of PCs, laptops and consoles, with the best performance permitted by the DisplayPort option - on HDMI, you'll be limited to 1440p 120Hz with VRR.
It should also be said that the 32GN600-B looks fantastic with a virtually borderless frame, complete with a mean-looking grey chassis and flecks of red to add a bit of flair. Its stand offers a good level of adjustment with some tilt adjust, and its port selection is pretty good, too, with that pair of HDMI out and a DP 1.4, as well as a headphone jack.
£229 isn't really a lot of money for a monitor as powerful as this one, and if you're in the market for a larger monitor with a whole lotta features, this is a fantastic choice."
"SAT refuses interim order on Sebi decision in Subhash Chandra, Punit Goenka matter",2023-06-15T11:40:00.000000000+00:00,"After hearing both parties, the SAT posted the matter for final disposal on Monday
Mumbai: The Securities Appellate Tribunal on Thursday sought the Securities and Exchange Board of India's (Sebi) response within 48 hours to a plea filed by Essel Group's Subhash Chandra and Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd.'s Punit Goenka challenging the regulator’s recent order. The tribunal refused to pass any interim order in the matter.
Sebi, in its order on Monday, restrained both Goenka and Chandra from holding any key managerial positions in any listed firms following allegations that they were involved in siphoning off funds.
After hearing both parties, the SAT, in an oral order, posted the matter for final disposal on Monday.
The SAT bench led by Justice Tarun Agarwala held that “We are of the opinion that passing an interim order at this stage will be virtually allowing the appeal. Consequently, we are of the opinion that we will decide the appeal finally, in this regard parties have agreed that they will file the replies at the earliest. Let replies be filed within 48 hours (2 days).""
Janak Dwarakadas, senior counsel representing Goenka in the matter argued that Sebi’s order is a ‘sham’. “I can demolish the order with strong points. We will be able to establish in two minutes that there was no investigation into this case and that this is a sham,"" he said.
“Even if the order is stayed, my (Goenka’s) reputation will be tarnished. What happens to my reputation and fundamental rights? If any authority of law thinks that fundamental rights can be trifled in such shabby manner, then we have much more to worry about as citizens"", Dwarkadas argued.
He argued before the bench that in Sebi’s order Goenka was alleged of using funds from a publicly listed company as his “piggyback"" which was virtually disruptive.“His reputation can never be restored"", Dwarkadas said.Adding that the order is likely to have significant impact since Goenka has not only been barred to hold key position but such positions in any listed entities.
The senior counsel also informed the tribunal regarding the pending approval from the NCLT in the ZEE- Sony merger case. “Sebi’s order will effectively derail the proposed merger between ZEE and Sony"", he said. Adding that merger has been approved by 96% of the shareholders of the company.
Senior counsel Somsekharan Sundaresan appearing for Subhash Chandra, while citing the Sebi’s 12 June order stated that the above facts make out a prima facie case of Chandra and Goenka having abused their position as directors/KMPs of a listed company for siphoning off funds for their own benefit. Further, although the promoter Family is only holding 3.99% shares in Zee, Subhash Chandra and Punit Goenka continue to be at the helm of affairs of Zee.
The senior counsel argued that Chandra currently is not at the helm of affairs at Zee and Sebi is wrong in mentioning so in its order. He added that Chandra is neither a director nor any key managerial personnel in any listed company or its subsidiaries. “If I am not a key director what is the need for the direction?""the counsel said."
Google Lens now uses AI to identify skin conditions,2023-06-15T11:39:09.000000000+00:00,"Google is expanding the capabilities of its computer vision-powered app, Google Lens, with a range of new features.
The app, which uses artificial intelligence to identify objects and provide relevant information, can now identify and surface skin conditions, such as moles and rashes. Users can upload pictures through Lens, initiating a search for visual matches.
The feature is not as advanced as the AI-driven skin, hair and nail condition diagnostic app that Google launched in the European Union in 2021.
The diagnostic app faced obstacles in the United States, where it would have required approval from the Food and Drug Administration, a step Google chose not to pursue. However, the Lens feature can still be valuable for individuals who are unsure whether to seek medical attention or try over-the-counter treatments.
Additionally, Google announced that Lens is integrating with Bard, the company's AI-powered chatbot experience. Users can now include images in their interactions with Bard, and Lens will assist Bard in understanding and providing accurate responses. For instance, if a user shows Bard a photo of shoes and asks for their name, Bard, informed by Lens' analysis, will provide an answer.
These updates are part of Google's ongoing investment in generative AI technologies, with a focus on enhancing the capabilities of Bard.
Last week, Google introduced a new capability that allows Bard to write, execute, and test its own code, improving its problem-solving and programming abilities. In May, Google collaborated with Adobe to enable art generation within Bard."

Latin American country joins Russia’s Visa alternative,2023-06-15T11:37:00.000000000+00:00,"Venezuela has begun to accept Mir cards, the head of the country’s central bank announced at SPIEF
Venezuelan banks have begun to accept Mir cards, Russia’s alternative to Visa and Mastercard, the head of the country’s central bank, Calixto Jose Ortega Sanchez, revealed at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF) on Thursday.
The Latin American country announced it was willing to join the Mir payment system last year and has since been in talks over the step. The Russian Embassy in Venezuela previously said that if Caracas connected to Mir, this would “create stable conditions for settlements in national currencies” between the two countries.
Russia’s Mir payment system has experienced a steady increase in demand for new cards since last year, according to the system’s operator. Around ten countries worldwide currently use the system, while roughly 15 others have expressed interest in adopting it.
The head of Myanmar’s central bank declared at SPIEF on Wednesday that his country would start accepting Mir cards by December. An agreement was also recently reached with Iran.

In March, Cuba announced the launch of Russia’s alternative to Western payment cards. Several banks in Havana have installed ATMs displaying the logo of the Mir system, and offer the option to withdraw cash using Russian bank cards in Cuban pesos.
Russia started developing its own national payment system after the US targeted it with sanctions in 2014. After Moscow was hit with further sanctions last year in response to the launch of its military operation in Ukraine, including the blocking of many Russian banks from SWIFT, the government began to promote its domestic version, SPFS, as a reliable alternative. The Russian system ensures the transfer of funds between banks inside and outside the country.

The Giants announced Jones’ death on Wednesday night.
""Homer Jones had a unique combination of speed and power and was a threat to score whenever he touched the ball,"" Giants CEO John Mara said, via the team’s website.
""He was one of the first players (if not the first) to spike the ball in the end zone after scoring a touchdown and he quickly became a fan favorite. I remember him as an easygoing, friendly individual who was well liked by his teammates and coaches.""

The Houston Oilers selected Jones in the fifth round of the 1963 AFL Draft but he never ended up playing for them. The Giants selected him in the 20th round of the 1963 NFL Draft and he made his first appearance with the team in 1964.

He finished his career with 224 catches for 4,986 yards and 36 touchdowns.
Most notably, Jones is credited as the first person to spike the football after a touchdown. After seeing superstar players of the time like Frank Gifford and Paul Hornung throw the ball into the stands after a score and get fined for it, Jones would spike the ball on a touchdown grab when he started the first game of his career in 1965.
""I was fixing to throw it into the grandstand,"" Jones recalled to ESPN in 2015. ""But just as I was raising my arm, the reality snapped into my head. (NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle) would have fined me. That was a lot of money in those days. So, I just threw the ball down into the end zone, into the grass. Folks got excited, and I did it for the rest of my career.""

Star Ocean 2 remake seemingly leaked on Square Enix site,2023-06-15T11:30:58.000000000+00:00,"Space-Ships
A mysterious new logo is being shared online this morning, purportedly an as-yet-unannounced new project in the popular fantasy franchise, Star Ocean. As reported by RPGSite, a banner for a “Star Ocean The Second Story R” was first discovered on the support site of IP owner Square Enix.
Originally released for PlayStation in 1998, Star Ocean: The Second Story is, as the name suggests, the second entry in the action-RPG series, which won over fans with its sci-fi/fantasy storytelling, myriad paths and conclusions, and very heavy emphasis on dating mechanics between multiple characters, allowing players to essentially dictate both narrative and gameplay through the pairing (or not) of relationships.
The “R” in the new banner suggests that this popular release may be in line for the remake/remaster treatment, though obviously, Square Enix is yet to speak on the discovery. Back in 2019, the publisher released the similarly titled Star Ocean First Departure R on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, which was itself a remaster of the PlayStation Portable (PSP) port of the first game in the series. Thus, a continuation along these lines is very likely, and very good news for Star Ocean fans.
Of course, we will be sure to keep you updated should Square Enix be forthcoming with any news.

Australian opposition party expels senator over sexual misconduct allegations,2023-06-15T11:29:03.000000000+00:00,"CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Australia's main opposition party expelled a senator on Thursday after a female senator accused him of sexual assault and a former senator said he squeezed her buttocks, in the latest evidence of a toxic culture in Parliament House that is hostile to women.
Opposition leader Peter Dutton said he expelled Sen. David Van from the conservative Liberal Party following allegations made in Parliament on Wednesday night by independent Sen. Lidia Thorpe of harassment and sexual assault. Van remains a senator, but no longer represents the Liberal Party.
Van denied the allegations, which were made under parliamentary privilege, under which no one can be sued for defamation over anything said in the Senate.
But he has yet to respond to the statement that followed from former Liberal Party Sen. Amanda Stoker that said Van had apologized for ''squeezing my bottom twice"" at Parliament House.
“I would have preferred that the matter be resolved privately and finally — as I thought it was. However, following Sen. Thorpe’s allegations, it is now clear that is no longer tenable,” Stoker said.
Political leaders apologized last year to staffers who have endured decades of bullying, harassment and sexual assault inside Parliament House which were exposed by an investigation by the national sex discrimination commissioner.
The investigation was triggered by a staffer's allegation that she was raped while drunk by a colleague in a minister’s office in 2019.
The staffer accused the then conservative government of treating her rape allegation as a political problem and of dissuading her from complaining to police.
Thorpe told the Senate on Thursday that Van harassed her around the time that the staffer's complaints captured national media attention two years ago.
The previous government had agreed with Thorpe’s request to shift Van to a different office to reduce their interaction walking to and from the Senate.
The Associated Press does not normally identify alleged victims of sexual assault but Thorpe made the accusations publicly.
Thorpe said Van groped her in a stairwell where there were no security cameras.
“There are different understandings of what amounts to sexual assault. What I experienced was being followed, aggressively propositioned and inappropriately touched,” Thorpe tearfully told the Senate.
She said she would not complain to police or sue in a civil court but had complained to the independent Parliamentary Workplace Support Service, which handles workplace complaints.
Van welcomed the service’s investigation of what he described as “outrageous claims.”
“Sen. Thorpe’s allegations are concocted from beginning to end. Nothing that she has alleged about me is truthful,” Van told the Senate.
There is a pattern of Australian male lawmakers using sexist and abusive behavior to undermine their female opponents.
Dutton didn't mention Stoker but suggested Thorpe’s allegations were not the only reason Van was expelled from the party.
“Since the airing of Sen. Thorpe’s allegation yesterday, further allegations in relation to Sen. Van have been brought to my attention overnight this morning,” Dutton told reporters.
“I’m not making any judgment on the veracity of allegations or any individual’s guilt or innocence. I make that very clear. Obviously, there’s an independent process with the Parliamentary Workplace Support Service to get under way,” Dutton said."

Meta's stellar stock rally has room to run further, according to Evercore ISI's head of Internet research.
Mark Mahaney thinks Meta is currently the ""best play"" in tech stocks as the stock remains relatively cheap based on some valuation metrics.
""It's the cheapest, high-quality large-cap tech stock out there,"" he told CNBC.
Meta Platforms shares have surged a staggering 127% this year, but the stock still has room to rally because it looks relatively cheap based on some valuation metrics, according to the head of Evercore ISI's Internet research team.
""Meta is actually still your best play,"" Mark Mahaney told CNBC on Wednesday. ""I know it's had a huge year-to-date rally, but it's trading at 15 times GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) earnings - it's the cheapest, high-quality large-cap tech stock out there.""
""There's a lot of upside in that stock,"" he added.
Mahaney expects Meta's favorable ""product cycles"" to help quicken revenue growth, while its cost-cutting plans should boost profit margins.
Tech stocks have outperformed this year after a dismal 2022, benefiting from the hype over artificial intelligence as well as investor expectations that the Federal Reserve will soon end its aggressive interest-rate increases.
""They had been so whacked down last year in terms of their multiples, in terms of estimates and then you had RIFs – reduction in force – which just meant the multiples were de-risked, the estimates were de-risked,"" Mahaney said, explaining how valuation metrics had turned favorable for tech stocks this year.

Tesla Cybertruck spotted in camouflage wrap. This is how Elon Musk reacts to leaked image,2023-06-15T11:27:00.000000000+00:00,"The Tesla Cybertruck, a highly anticipated electric vehicle globally, has generated significant interest since its introduction in 2019. Despite multiple projected production timelines, the electric pickup truck has not yet begun manufacturing.
Elon Musk has announced that production of the Cybertruck will begin in September 2023, and recently, there have been frequent sightings of prototypes of the vehicle, some of which have been covered in camouflage wraps.
Contrary to the high expectations surrounding the Cybertruck, previous sightings of its prototypes did not feature any camouflage. However, the most recent prototype spotted in a real-world setting stood out because it was the first-ever Tesla Cybertruck prototype observed with official factory camouflage.
In Palo Alto, California, a recent sighting of a Tesla Cybertruck prototype revealed that it was concealed by a camouflage vinyl wrap. The discovery was shared on the Cybertruck Owners Club forum, and upon inspection, there were no discernible differences from previously spotted prototypes. This occurrence is surprising because Tesla has historically shown little enthusiasm for using camouflage wraps on its test prototypes, resorting to this practice only on rare occasions.

It is possible that this represents a new strategy aimed at attracting more attention, or it could indicate that the company is reconsidering its stance on the use of camouflage wraps. Typically, automakers employ such wraps on their test prototypes of new or updated models to conceal design details, proportions, and other features that are not yet known to the public.
After the camouflaged prototype images of the Tesla Cybertruck gained widespread attention on Twitter, CEO Elon Musk amusingly remarked, ""Good thing we used camo lol."" Production of the Cybertruck is scheduled to commence in September of this year at the Giga Texas factory in the United States.

Initially, the electric pickup truck will be manufactured in limited quantities. However, Tesla CEO Musk has disclosed that the production rate will escalate from 2024 onwards."
BTC Halving Events Provide Little Guidance for Next One: Coinbase,2023-06-15T11:26:04.000000000+00:00,"It is possible that the next bitcoin (BTC) halving, expected in second-quarter 2024, will have a positive impact on the cryptocurrency’s performance, but that’s not a foregone conclusion, Coinbase (COIN) said in a report Wednesday.
“Getting a clear picture of how markets reacted to previous bitcoin halving episodes requires disentangling the effect of liquidity, rates and U.S. dollar movements,” analyst David Duong wrote.
The halving of the block reward is often viewed positively because it enhances bitcoin’s “prospective scarcity” and supports its supply/demand dynamics, the note said. When bitcoin halving occurs, rewards are cut by 50%.
Still, with only three recorded halving events in the past, evidence of how markets react is limited, the note added. It is difficult to see a clear pattern, particularly as the events were “contaminated by factors like global liquidity measures,” the report said.
Coinbase says global liquidity appears to have peaked in the near term, noting that there’s still another 9-10 months till the next halving, “which makes it unclear what the net effect on bitcoin’s price behavior might be.”
Retail demand for the largest cryptocurrency is likely to remain strong ahead of the event, according to Wall Street giant JPMorgan (JPM)."
Is North Korea's Phishing Website Trying To Steal South Koreans' Personal Data?,2023-06-15T11:23:00.000000000+00:00,"KEY POINTS
As per South Korea's spy agency, the North Korean phishing portal is replicating the sign-in page of Naver
Naver is South Korea's largest online portal and search engine
The NIS said the agency was taking necessary action to safeguard the users' details
Seoul's spy agency National Intelligence Service (NIS) has alleged that North Korea is engaged in a cyber espionage campaign aimed at stealing the personal data of South Koreans.
The NIS stated North Korea was operating a phishing website that replicated South Korea's largest online portal and search engine, Naver, in real time. This website was designed to trick users into revealing their personal information, according to Reuters.
The NIS has issued a warning to the public, urging them to exercise caution and remain vigilant regarding web addresses to protect themselves from falling victim to such cyberattacks.
In a press release, the spy agency stated that North Korea has been making efforts to acquire user data through multiple counterfeit Naver websites. These deceptive websites are designed to appear as legitimate Naver platforms, but are operated by malicious actors from North Korea.
The National Intelligence Service emphasized the need for heightened caution among internet users to avoid falling prey to these fraudulent websites.
""If the domain address is not the legitimate Naver access domain ― www.naver.com ― such as www.naverportal.com, please immediately stop accessing it,"" the NIS said in the release, Wion reported.
As per the NIS' findings, the North Korean phishing portal is replicating the sign-in page of Naver. By creating counterfeit login pages that closely resemble the authentic Naver sign-in page, the intention is to trick South Korean users into entering their login credentials. Once users unknowingly provide their usernames and passwords, the people behind the fake website gain unauthorized access to their genuine Naver accounts.
The recent counterfeit websites created by North Korea have advanced capabilities that enable them to mirror real-time content from Naver, including news, ad banners, finance information, and other data displayed on the Naver homepage.
""Their cyberattack techniques have evolved to improve the possibility of stealing personal information,"" an official at the NIS said, according to Reuters.
In an effort to safeguard citizens, NIS has shared pertinent information with the government, public institutions, and the Korea Internet & Security Agency. These organizations have taken swift action to implement measures aimed at blocking access to phishing sites.
To track the North Korean phishing sites effectively, the NIS is actively cooperating with international agencies by sharing relevant information as the servers are located overseas.

The projected fair value for BJ's Wholesale Club Holdings is US$104 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity
BJ's Wholesale Club Holdings' US$62.20 share price signals that it might be 40% undervalued
The US$77.39 analyst price target for BJ is 25% less than our estimate of fair value
Does the June share price for BJ's Wholesale Club Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:BJ) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.
Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model.
See our latest analysis for BJ's Wholesale Club Holdings
The Model
We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:

Google's big AI push: Four AI-powered features in Gmail you can use,2023-06-15T11:17:00.000000000+00:00,"Google’s AI push continues to get stronger with each passing week. The tech giant has revealed a host of AI-related features that are now in Gmail, the world’s most popular email service. Here are four AI-powered features in Gmail that you can use:
Use Smart compose
Not a new feature as such but extremely useful. According to Google, Smart compose uses a hybrid language generation modeland runs it on Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) to show wording suggestions. A simple tap of the “Tab” button accepts the suggestion and incorporates those words into your email draft without you having to fully type them out, explains Google.
Tabbed inbox
If you are a Gmail users, then you would have seen how there are different inboxes for different things. Primary, Promotion and Social are among the few tabbed inboxes Gmail has. Gmail uses machine learning on a classification system, which then decides where the email should go. The messages then go into one of five different inbox tabs: Primary, Promotions, Social, Updates and Forums. (You can use as many or as few of these tabs as you want.) “To automatically categorise these emails, Gmail uses a combination of neural network-based machine learning and heuristic algorithms (heuristic algorithms use AI-generated decision trees to make choices),” Google said in a blog post.
Summary cards
Another feature that has been pretty much around for a while and uses AI and machine learning is Summary Cards. Any time you book a flight and get a ticket in your inbox, chances are a summary card will appear, giving you the important details in a concise manner. Google says that this done by “using heuristic and machine learning algorithms, summary card technology automatically looks for certain data from inbound emails to understand what type of message it is and the most important content in the message.”
Need a nudge?
Nudging is the first Gmail AI feature that runs on both emails you have received and sent. It is a feature that reminds you to reply to a mail or an important message. “For inbound emails, Nudging uses a machine learning model to detect which emails you haven’t replied to and predict which of them you’d normally answer,” explained Google in a blog post."

Tesla’s Record Winning Streak Starts to Unwind After 41% Surge,2023-06-15T11:10:00.000000000+00:00,"A day after snapping its longest-ever winning streak, Tesla Inc. is embarking on a losing run.
The stock slid 3.2% as of 7:04 a.m. in New York premarket trading, having fallen 0.7% on Wednesday to halt 13 straight sessions of gains.
Tesla rose 41% in a 13-day ascent through Tuesday, pushing the world’s most valuable automaker deep into overbought territory. Its relative strength index rose to 88 earlier this week, far above the level of 70 that signals to some technical analysts that a stock may have risen too far, too fast.
The rally was fueled by positive newsflow that included General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co. making moves to adapt their electric vehicles to Tesla’s Superchargers, Tesla Model 3 sedans becoming eligible for the full US tax credit, and a broader investor hunger for artificial intelligence stocks.
However, the hawkish stance taken by the Federal Reserve on Wednesday has caused shares of the year’s biggest winners to take a breather. Nvidia Corp., which has led megacap tech stocks higher this year, also fell in premarket trading, set to snap a five-day winning streak. Nasdaq 100 Index futures were trading down 0.7%

Huawei Is Not Getting 5G Chips From Qualcomm; the Rumors Are Fake!,2023-06-15T11:09:38.000000000+00:00,"In case you are unaware, the US banned the use of telecommunications equipment from foreign firms deemed a national security risk. Huawei is also placed on a trade blocklist, which restricts most US suppliers from supplying goods and technology to the company. It was part of an executive order that came into effect on May 15, 2019.
But on June 12, 2023, a rumor was circulating in the Chinese media sources. It stated that the US would be allowing Qualcomm to sell 5G chipsets to Huawei. People from the industry backed the rumor by stating that the US has loosened its strictness for some chip export.
Those were some big claims. And if they turned out to be true, Huawei could jump right into the global competition and launch 5G smartphones. It would have also ramped up Qualcomm’s business. But on June 13, 2023, the head of Huawei Consumer Business Group denied the report!
Huawei Is Not Getting 5G Chipsets From the US, But There’s Good News
According to the head of the Consumer Business Group of Huawei, the company will not be getting 5G chipsets from Qualcomm. That is, the rumors that were circulating on Chinese social media are fake.

"Stellantis invests 100 million euros in startups, mobility fund",2023-06-15T11:08:00.000000000+00:00,"DETROIT (Reuters) - The venture capital arm of automaker Stellantis said on Thursday it will invest about 100 million euros ($108.3 million) in automotive and battery technology startups and a mobility venture fund.
Stellantis Ventures, created last year with 300 million euros of initial capital, will put money in ten startups ranging from Nauto, which provides driver monitoring and risk-management technology to fleets, to battery technology startup Electra Vehicles, to Beweelsociety, an electric bike venture started within Stellantis, Adam Bazih, head of Stellantis Ventures, said in a videoconference.
Stellantis said it will offer Nauto technology on commercial fleet vehicles beginning this summer.
Stellantis Ventures will put an undisclosed amount into a mobility venture fund that Bazih said he could not name because it has not finalized regulatory paperwork.
The company is one of several established automakers that have set up venture capital arms to gain access to new technology and talent.
""They are high-risk bets,"" Bazih said, acknowledging volatility in capital markets. Venture capital investments can go wrong 70 to 80% of the time, he said. ""The 20% .. .hopefully carries the rest.""

"Morgan Stanley reinstates this mobile carrier as a top pick, says shares could surge nearly 40%",2023-06-15T11:05:44.000000000+00:00,"“Patience should be rewarded,” Morgan Stanley said about T-Mobile shares. The firm reinstated T-Mobile to its list of top picks in telecom services. Analyst Simon Flannery maintained his overweight rating on shares, while increasing his price target by $1 to $178. His target price implies 39% upside from where shares closed on Thursday. “T-Mobile is one of the only companies in our coverage (along with Iridium) with a sizable buyback program who is able to take advantage of market volatility. The company offers investors low leverage, strong FCF generation, a recurring revenue model, network leadership, growing market share and reasonable valuations,” Flannery wrote in a Thursday note. The analyst said the recent weakness in the telecom services sector creates an opportunity for T-Mobile to execute the rest of its $14 billion share buyback program at lower prices, “creating more value for shareholders.” Flannery noted temporary headwinds from wholesale traffic off-loading by DISH and Verizon are temporary headwinds to T-Mobile shares. The company’s ability to outperform the sector may become harder as it gains more market share, he added. Shares are down more than 8% year to date. The stock is still up 1.2% over the past 12 months. Morgan Stanley said it expects the stock “to break out of this range over the next few months driven by operating and technical factors.” The firm expects T-Mobile to continue to take share in the wireless industry while its newly-launched 5G plan supports service revenue growth.

Sony is testing cloud streaming for PS5 games,2023-06-15T11:04:00.000000000+00:00,"Sony has announced that it is currently testing the feature to stream PS5 games from the cloud, and plans to offer it as a feature in its PlayStation Plus Premium subscription. These include titles from the PS Plus Game Catalog, game trials, and other supported digital content.
""We are currently testing cloud streaming for supported PS5 games – this includes PS5 titles from the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog and Game Trials, as well as supported digital PS5 titles that players own,"" Nick Maguire, VP of global services, global sales, and business operations, Sony Interactive Entertainment said. ""When this feature launches, cloud game streaming for supported PS5 titles will be available for use directly on your PS5 console. That means as a Premium member; it'll be easier to jump into your favourite games without downloading them first onto your PS5 console.""
Sony currently offers Remote Play that supports streaming PS5 games to PCs, Macs, and both iOS and Android devices. However, to download and stream titles on other devices, you must use your PS5 as the host. Although, with the new cloud streaming, Premium tier subscribers will be able to play the games without downloading on their console.
For months, it has been reported that Sony was working on cloud streaming. Recent job postings suggested a new emphasis on cloud gaming, and PlayStation chief Jim Ryan hinted at ""quite aggressive plans"" for cloud gaming last month, introducing the Project Q handheld.
It is not known if the Project Q handheld console would support cloud streaming. Sony only confirmed Wi-Fi streaming of PS5 games directly from a console when they unveiled their new PlayStation handheld, codenamed Project Q.
Sony did not divulge much into the details, Maguire saying “We are in the early stages right now, and we can’t wait to share more details when we are ready, including a launch time frame.” “We think it’s important for Premium members to be able to enjoy as many games as possible via cloud streaming,” he further added."
Continental launches UltraContact tyre range made of upto 65% renewable materials,2023-06-15T11:03:00.000000000+00:00,"Continental has launched what it claims is its most sustainable series tyre to date – the UltraContact NXT. The tyre uses up to 65 percent renewable, recycled and mass balance certified materials, which it says combines a remarkably high share of sustainable materials with maximum safety and performance.
The German company claims to be the first manufacturer to launch a tyre with both a high share of sustainable materials and maximum EU tire-label performance in volume production. All 19 sizes available will carry the highest possible rating (A) of the EU tire label in rolling resistance, wet braking, and exterior noise. The UltraContact NXT will be available for tyre dealers in Europe this July.
Ferdinand Hoyos, Head of Continental’s Business Area Replacement Tires EMEA said, “This development represents a significant leap forward and demonstrates our technological leadership as well as our strong commitment to both sustainability and safety. With its impressive performance, the UltraContact NXT pushes sustainability to the NXT level.”
Depending on the tyre size, the UltraContact NXT is made from up to 65 percent renewable, recycled and mass balance certified materials. Renewable materials stand up to 32 percent. The proportion of recyclable materials is up to 5 percent. Furthermore, Continental says it has sourced an amount of up to 28 percent ISCC PLUS mass balance approach certified materials from bio, bio-circular and/or circular feedstock.
The renewable materials account for up to 32 percent of the UltraContact NXT. This includes resins based on residual materials from the paper and wood industries. Used in tyres, resins allow highly flexible compounds to improve the material’s grip. The Ultra Contact NXT contains silicate from the ash of rice husks. Rice husks are an agricultural waste product which may be processed into silica through a new, less energy consuming process. It helps to optimise characteristics such as grip, rolling resistance and tyre life. As in every tyre, natural rubber is a key material of the UltraContact NXT. It remains indispensable as it ensures the highest tyre performance properties because of its elevated level of strength and durability.
The special logo ‘contains recycled materials’ on the sidewall of the UltraContact NXT underlines the use of recycled materials in this tyre line. The share of recycled material stands at up to five percent. It includes recycled rubber material, which comes from mechanically processed end-of-life tyres. In addition, Continental is using recycled steel in the UltraContact NXT. The already presented innovative ContiRe.Tex technology has also been adopted for the UltraContact NXT. It generates high-performance polyester fibres used to reinforce the tyre carcass through recycling PET bottles, which otherwise would have ended up in incinerators or landfills. With the ContiRe.Tex technology, Continental has developed a more energy-efficient and eco-friendly alternative that allows it to recycle between 9 and 15 plastic bottles for each tyre, depending on the size. Continental is aiming for fully circular operations in its tyre production by 2050 at the latest.
By 2030 the tyre manufacturer aims to have over 40 percent renewable and recycled content in its tyres. Continental says it will continue its drive towards 100 percent sustainable materials in all its tyre products by 2050 the latest.
The UltraContact NXT is designed for both electric and combustion engines."

Nissan’s New Aero-Focused AI Design Tool Delivers Results In Seconds Instead Of Days,2023-06-15T11:00:00.000000000+00:00,"Artificial intelligence was once the stuff of science fiction, but it’s here and changing the world as we know it. Nissan is preparing for this new reality and their Yokohama Lab is exploring how AI can help to create the cars of the future.
The company says there’s no shortage of potential applications as “it’s become clear that AI can be applied in various fields, including R&D, vehicle production and even design.” Speaking of the latter, the company noted AI can play an important role when it comes to aerodynamics.
As the automaker explained, “Aerodynamic performance is currently evaluated by performing repetitive and complex calculations on powerful computers.” These calculations predict performance and show airflow, but “to achieve more accurate results through simulation, a vast number of intricate calculations” are required and these can take hundreds of computers several days to complete. That’s far from ideal and Nissan’s Kei Akasaka noted it’s “very challenging to quickly respond to sudden requests from designers.”

This got Nissan thinking about how to improve things with AI. After some initial setbacks, the company spent over a year training and generating data for the AI model. Even then, the team wasn’t able to get the accuracy they desired so they trained the model with “paired information such as fluid dynamics equations and other physical laws in addition to the shape of the car.”
While that’s just a brief overview of the process, the results speak for themselves as the AI was able to “dramatically shorten the duration of simulations by learning the relationship between the shape of the car and its aerodynamic performance based on a large amount of data.” The company added they can now predict aerodynamic performance of designs in a few seconds rather than several days.

Besides saving a ton of time, Nissan said the use of AI will likely lead to “innovative vehicle body shapes that achieve a better level of balance between design and aerodynamics.”
Nissan isn’t the only automaker exploring the possibilities of AI as Audi is using the technology to design the wheels of the future. As we reported last year, Audi developed AI known as FelGAN, which can propose a large number of photo-realistic wheel designs or recombine existing designs into something new. Human designers then use these images for inspiration and to get new ideas."

Star Ocean 2 might be the next classic JRPG to get a remake,2023-06-15T11:00:00.000000000+00:00,"A Star Ocean 2 remake could well have just been leaked by Square Enix.
As RPG Site first reported earlier today on June 15, a logo for something called 'Star Ocean: The Second Story R' was found on a Square Enix support website. Star Ocean: The Second Story is the name of the second Star Ocean game, if you're unfamiliar with Square Enix's long-running RPG series.
The second game in the Star Ocean series was originally released all the way back in 1998 for the PlayStation 1. Square Enix already remade the original Star Ocean, and that remake was a PSP-exclusive for a few years back in 2007, but there's never been a remake of Star Ocean: The Second Story.
Considering this, it'd be a huge win for game preservation and Star Ocean fans at large to get a remake of the second game in the series. Bringing forward a game from back in 1998 for a potential brand new audience and die-hard fans alike is always a great thing, and the thought of an old game becoming unplayable is what spurred on Square Enix to re-release Chrono Cross.
As RPG Site notes though, 'The Second Story' subtitle was actually attached to the original 1998 game, whereas the 2008 PSP remake had the subtitle of 'The Second Evolution R.' It's perhaps a little premature to say this unannounced project could be a remake of the original game rather than the PSP version, but it's certainly a decent indicator.
Head over to our new games 2023 guide for a look at some other RPGs you can get your hands on before Star Ocean 2 is possibly remade."
Rivian Booted Out Of Nasdaq 100 In Favor Of EV Chip Maker,2023-06-15T11:00:00.000000000+00:00,"It hasn’t all been plain sailing for Rivian since the EV startup first hit the stock exchange in 2021 and each share in the company commanded a hefty $129.95. Fast forward to this month and those same shares have plunged nearly 90 percent, including a 20 percent drop this year, and are currently trading at just $14.74.
And there’s more bad news this week. Rivian’s poor performance has resulted in it losing its spot on the prestigious Nasdaq 100. The index lists the 100 biggest non-financial firms on the New York-based Nasdaq stock exchange and includes heavy hitters like Apple and Microsoft.
Rivian is being removed because its stock was weighted as less than 0.1 percent of the index in April and May. The Nasdaq 100 normally removes its smallest members after two consecutive months of being that low, and just as JPMorgan Chase analyst Min Moon predicted last month, Rivian is out.
Related: EV Startups Fisker, Lucid And Nikola Stumble As Q1 Results Underwhelm And Share Prices Slide
Moon also correctly predicted Rivian’s replacement in the Nasdaq 100. The incoming company is On Semiconductor, which is located in Arizona and is in the business of supplying chips to automakers building electric cars. Talk about a cruel irony.
Other EV startups like Lucid, Nikola and Lordstown, have all had a tough time lately, suffering falling share prices. Nikola received a delisting notice from Nasdaq in May because its shares had been trading below $1 for 30 consecutive days and Lordstown had to perform a reverse stock split to save its shares from dipping below $1 and the company suffering the same fate.

What all of these firms has in common is that their valuations were way out of sync with the number of cars they had produced, or were going to produce any time soon, and made legacy automakers’ stock look dirt cheap. But the original EV startup, Tesla, which has proved itself a viable force in the auto industry, has bounced back after its stock fell to a two-year low in January of this year."
Report: The Tesla Cybertruck has serious engineering problems,2023-06-15T11:00:00.000000000+00:00,"Believe it or not, it’s been nearly four years since Elon Musk previewed the Tesla Cybertruck to the world. Yup, 2019 was that long ago, and the truck still isn’t in production. Musk initially said it will be available in 2021, but the delivery dates have been repeatedly pushed back since.
So, what’s the hold up? Granted, the world shut down for the most part in 2020, but there are reasons within Tesla for the delay. According to “The Tesla Files”, a document leaked by a company whistleblower, the Cybertruck has serious development and engineering flaws.

ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW ↓
Wired Magazine published the juicer bits of the report recently, and it could be one of several reasons why the truck has been delayed for nearly four years. Per the magazine, the whistleblower’s report was dated January 25, 2022. It’s possible that some progress has been made, but we’re not expecting the production version of the Cybertruck to be revealed anytime soon.
For starters, the Cybertruck’s slab sides and flat panels presented an unusual problem. The report noted difficulties in sealing the truck’s body, resulting in leaks and noise seeping into the interior. Granted, the vehicle tested was a prototype, but it was an ‘Alpha’ model that’s supposed to have most of the basic and fundamental engineering basics nailed down. However, the ‘Alpha’ Cybertruck had issues even with the basics, per the report.
But leaks and squeaks weren’t the only issues uncovered in the report. There are serious concerns regarding the Cybertruck’s chassis and structure, particularly in regard to stiffness. Tesla can either soften it but risk total structure failure, or stiffen it but cause serious handling and dynamic problems.
And speaking of handling and dynamic problems, the report mentioned “excessive mid-speed abruptness and chop,” “high head-toss accelerations,” and more worryingly, “structural shake”. Also noted were “excessive lateral jerk during low-speed maneuvering” along with poor steering refinement and excessive body roll. The brakes were of highest concern due to instability during hard stops, as well as excess body pitching, inconsistent stopping distances, and deep pedal travel.
So, will the Cybertruck be delayed again? Prior to the report, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said that the first customers will receive their electric pickup by the third quarter of 2023. Musk added that mass rollout of the Cybertruck will begin in 2024 with a sales target of 375,000 per year.
Still, we're not expecting it to come out earlier, but at least the Hot Wheels version was made available to consumers."
"With 77% institutional ownership, General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) is a favorite amongst the big guns",2023-06-15T11:00:00.000000000+00:00,"Key Insights
Institutions' substantial holdings in General Electric implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price
50% of the business is held by the top 9 shareholders
Insiders have been selling lately
Every investor in General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 77% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.
Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.
Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of General Electric, beginning with the chart below.
See our latest analysis for General Electric
What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About General Electric?
Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.
As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in General Electric. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see General Electric's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.
Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. General Electric is not owned by hedge funds. Capital Research and Management Company is currently the company's largest shareholder with 15% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.1% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 6.2% by the third-largest shareholder.
Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of General Electric Company in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$288m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can
While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted you should be aware of, and 1 of them is a bit concerning.

BYD overtakes Tesla to become Singapore’s top-selling EV brand for the first five months of 2023,2023-06-15T10:58:08.000000000+00:00,"BYD has overtaken Tesla as the top-selling electric vehicle brand in Singapore, with the Chinese automaker surging ahead of the American brand in units sold for the first five months of 2023, the Straits Times reports.
According to data from the country’s land transport authority (LTA), BYD registered 303 EVs in the republic from January to May, putting it ahead of Tesla, which managed 283 units during the same period. In third place was BMW with 249 units. About 20% of BYD sales were to private-hire operators.
While the race to determine the No 1 spot for the year still remains open, with quite a way to go, BYD will fancy its chances on finishing top when the time comes. Although Tesla remained the market leader in Singapore last year, its lead had dropped from 53.1% of all EVs registered in 2021 to 24.1% in 2022. The biggest gainer in terms of registration figures was BYD, which finished just 89 units behind Tesla in 2022.
The LTA indicated that 1,462 electric cars were registered in the first five months of 2023, accounting for 13.4% of total vehicle registrations, up slightly from the 11.7% recorded in the same period last year. However, the total number of EVs in Singapore remains low, with just 7,961 electric cars on the road as of end-May, accounting for just 1.2% of the total car population.
The report added that half of the top 10 bestsellers, which includes the likes of Mercedes-Benz (171 units), Hyundai (56), Polestar (51), Porsche (43) and MG (42), suffered a dip in market share. Newcomers to the top 10 list for the January-May period were Opel and Volvo, the former’s volume (98 units) coming from its EVs replacing the Bluecar in electric car-sharing company BlueSG‘s fleet, while Volvo (57) replaced Audi in the list."
Key EU nature restoration vote put on hold,2023-06-15T10:55:45.000000000+00:00,"STRASBOURG — The European Parliament's environment committee Thursday ran out of time to agree its position on contentious new EU rules aimed at boosting nature restoration across the bloc.
MEPs will finish voting on the text at their next ENVI Committee meeting, currently scheduled to take place on June 26 or 27 in Brussels.
The meeting started with a blow to the conservative European People's Party, whose bid to reject the legislative proposal outright did not get a majority — the vote was tied with 44 in favor and 44 against — and was dismissed as a result.
Lawmakers proceeded to vote on the compromise amendments drafted by lead MEP César Luena from the Socialists & Democrats, as well as on individuals amendments filed by other MEPs.
Committee chair Pascal Canfin was forced to put the lengthy process on hold at 11:45 a.m., the official end-time of the committee meeting, and ask political groups to agree to delay a separate plenary vote schedule to start at noon. The groups voted in favor, buying the ENVI Committee an additional 15 minutes to continue voting on the amendments.
But that extra time wasn't enough to wrap up voting on the remaining amendments, forcing Canfin to close the meeting and postpone the rest of the vote.
The nature rules — a key part of the Green Deal — have come under fire from conservative MEPs and farmers' groups, who claim they threaten farmers’ livelihoods by potentially taking their land away and undermining food security — something scientists and the European Commission deny."

Australian Opposition Party Expels Senator Over Sexual Misconduct Allegations,2023-06-15T10:52:00.000000000+00:00,"Independent Senator Lidia Thorpe makes a statement in the senate chamber at Australia's Parliament House in Canberra, Thursday, June 15, 2023.

(Mick Tsikas/AAP Image via AP)
CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Australia's main opposition party expelled a senator on Thursday after a female senator accused him of sexual assault in the latest evidence of a toxic culture in Parliament House that is hostile to women.
Opposition leader Peter Dutton said he expelled Sen. David Van from the conservative Liberal Party following allegations made in Parliament on Wednesday night by independent Sen. Lidia Thorpe of harassment and sexual assault. Van remains a senator, but no longer represents the Liberal Party.
Van denied the allegations, which were made under parliamentary privilege, under which no one can be sued for defamation over anything said in the Senate.
Political leaders apologized last year to staffers who have endured decades of bullying, harassment and sexual assault inside Parliament House which were exposed by an investigation by the national sex discrimination commissioner.
The investigation was triggered by a staffer's allegation that she was raped while drunk by a colleague in a minister’s office in 2019.
The staffer accused the then conservative government of treating her rape allegation as a political problem and of dissuading her from complaining to police.
Thorpe told the Senate on Thursday that Van harassed her around the time that the staffer's complaints captured national media attention two years ago.
The previous government had agreed with Thorpe’s request to shift Van to a different office to reduce their interaction walking to and from the Senate.
The Associated Press does not normally identify alleged victims of sexual assault but Thorpe made the accusations publicly.
Thorpe said Van groped her in a stairwell where there were no security cameras.
“There are different understandings of what amounts to sexual assault. What I experienced was being followed, aggressively propositioned and inappropriately touched,” Thorpe tearfully told the Senate.
She said she would not complain to police or sue in a civil court but had complained to the independent Parliamentary Workplace Support Service, which handles workplace complaints.
Van welcomed the service’s investigation of what he described as “outrageous claims.”
“Sen. Thorpe’s allegations are concocted from beginning to end. Nothing that she has alleged about me is truthful,” Van told the Senate.
There is a pattern of Australian male lawmakers using sexist and abusive behavior to undermine their female opponents.
Dutton suggested Thorpe’s allegations were not the only reason Van was expelled from the party.
“Since the airing of Sen. Thorpe’s allegation yesterday, further allegations in relation to Sen. Van have been brought to my attention overnight this morning,” Dutton told reporters.
“I’m not making any judgment on the veracity of allegations or any individual’s guilt or innocence. I make that very clear. Obviously, there’s an independent process with the Parliamentary Workplace Support service to get under way,” Dutton said."
EastEnders’ Bobby Brazier dating stunning Twitch streamer as he makes first public appearance with her,2023-06-15T10:50:40.000000000+00:00,"ROMANCE is in the air for EastEnders star Bobby Brazier as he finds love with new influencer girlfriend Mia Monaghan.
The Sun can exclusively reveal that Bobby, 20, is dating 24-year-old Twitch streamer Mia, with a source telling us that the pair looked ""very loved up"" at last night's Taste of London event.
The couple made their first public appearance as they attended the food festival in Regent's Park.
Bobby looked in good spirits as he wrapped his arms around the social media star, who boasts a huge 52.9k followers on her Twitch platform.
The Albert Square actor looked trendy in a classic grey t-shirt and matching shorts, paired with some black sandals.
While TikTok star Mia sported a white midi dress with ruffle sleeves, with a thigh-high split along the front.
She finished off her chic summer look with a pair of sunglasses, white trainers and a gold pendent necklace.
Mia styled her dark tresses into a slicked-back bun and opted for a subtle make-up palette for the summer outing.
The happy couple beamed for a series of snaps, with Bobby flashing a big smile as he warmly embraced his new beau.
A source told The Sun: ""Bobby looked really happy with the stunning brunette. He couldn't keep his eyes off of her.
""The pair were laughing and joking around. They looked really cute together and seemed pretty in love.
""They both looked chuffed to be making their relationship public and were happy to pose for photos.
""It looked like they were having a lot of fun enjoying a day out together and were knocking back the champagne and oysters.
""Bobby looked really at ease as they chilled out in the VIP area.
""It was great to see the EastEnders lad find someone special - it looks like she really makes him happy.""
Mia is a social media star with a huge Instagram following of 195k and a staggering 373.8k fans on TikTok.
While her Twitch bio reads: ""Very epic gamer. I stream a variety of different games daily and spend a lot of time vibing with chat.""
Bobby - who is the son of the late Jade Goody - split from his model girlfriend Liberty Love last July.
Insiders said his relationship with model was over just two months after they went public.
The pair first went public last May, and attended a series of red carpet events together.
Back in October, he was snapped snogging two women at the National Television Awards, before eventually leaving the bash with a third girl.
At the time Bobby insisted: ""I'm very affectionate with my people. Can get me in trouble or situations sometimes but it's instinctive.
""Lots of rumours but bottom line is I just love a cuddle.""
Model Bobby is the son of TV presenter Jeff Brazier, 44, and Jade, who died of cervical cancer in 2009 aged 27.
He plays Freddie Slater, the son of Maureen “Little Mo” Slater, on the BBC One soap."

Citadel looks to credit bets as US recession looms,2023-06-15T10:50:00.000000000+00:00,"The prospect of the US economy going into recession later this year, has prompted Citadel boss Ken Griffin, whose firm racked up a record $16 billion return for clients last year, to increase his focus on credit trading, according to a report by Bloomberg.
In an interview in Hong Kong, Griffin reportedly said that his hedge fund is particularly focused on the high-yield credit market, with a mix of long and short strategies. “We’ll look at the credit markets as a source of opportunity,"" he said. ""Credit should be a meaningful contributor later this year, and next for Citadel.""
The Federal Reserve paused its programme of interest rate hikes for the first time in 15 months this week following a slowdown in US inflation in May, although Griffin is expecting one further increase before an extended pause.
According to Bloomberg Economics, the current baseline is for a US recession to start in the third quarter of this year, while a Bloomberg survey of analysts puts the probability of one occurring within the next 12 months at 65%.
According to unnamed Bloomberg sources, Citadel’s flagship Wellington fund is up 6.1% so far this year, while the firm’s equities, fixed income & macro, commodities, quant, and credit strategies all delivered positive returns last month."
Spotify removes protest song Glory to Hong Kong,2023-06-15T10:50:00.000000000+00:00,"The unofficial anthem of Hong Kong’s besieged protest movement has been quietly removed from music streaming services including Spotify and iTunes in the territory.
The authorities in the former British colony have sought to stop people being able to play Glory to Hong Kong, which has been sung by protesters since 2019.
Its final verse says: “Break now the dawn, liberate our Hong Kong/ In common breath: Revolution of our times/ May people reign, proud and free, now and evermore/ Glory be to thee Hong Kong.”
Spotify told Hong Kong media that the protest song had been removed by its creator and distributor, Dgxmusic, which said it was having “some technical issues” unrelated to the streaming platforms. “Sorry for the temporary effect,” it said."
"iPhone users switch to Android, but the real traffic is in the other direction",2023-06-15T10:50:00.000000000+00:00,"When choosing a mobile platform, most people are loyal to one of the two options available: iPhone or Android. But people do switch to the other side, with iPhone usually making the news for enticing Android switchers. That might upset the latter group, especially diehard fans who don’t like to hear that more people switch from their favorite OS to iPhone. But that’s always been the reality. We’ve been getting periodic reports on the matter, and the latest data further cements that idea. And it turns out that Google has bigger problems to fix to make Android more attractive to iPhone users than iMessage.
There are iPhone users who switch to Android, of course. And we have data on the matter that gives us an actual figure. But it’s hardly a match for the Android to iPhone switchers figure.
Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP) released two reports in recent weeks. One revealed that between 10% and 15% of new iPhone buyers in the US come from Android. The other mentioned the reasons why people switch from Android to iPhone. And iMessage was not the number one reason people wanted an iPhone.
CIRP followed up with a third report that also quantifies the number of switchers from iPhone to Android.
The new analysis shows that 14% of iPhone buyers came from Android in the US over the last 12 months. Comparatively, only 4% of Android buyers came from iPhone. That’s a huge difference in favor of Apple that can’t be denied.
Since we’re looking at percentages only, they might be misleading without knowing the market share of each operating system in the US. Thankfully, Statista has accurate data that show Apple and Google have practically split the mobile business in the US. There are no other options than iPhone and Android.
The most recent data (March 2023) says iPhone accounts for 53.1% of the US market, with Android coming in second at 46.46%. And Apple has been at the top since May 2020. The iPhone and Android user bases are roughly equal in the US. And that has been the case for several years.
Therefore, the difference between iPhone-to-Android and Android-to-iPhone switchers is significant. And it doesn’t look like Apple has anything to fear about losing that edge to Android. The previous CIRP report said that Android users who switch to Android are unhappy with their Android hardware or want new phone features available on iPhone.
In addition to looking at the number of iPhone-to-Android switchers in the latest report, CIRP also analyzed loyalty. Unsurprisingly, CIRP found that 94% of iPhone users chose to stick with iOS. Comparatively, only 91% of Android users were happy to stay on Google’s operating system.
Android users looking to switch to iPhone might want to wait for the iPhone 15 series, which launches in September. Meanwhile, iPhone users who want an Android phone are in for a wave of exciting Android releases in the second half of 2023.
The Pixel Fold phone will hit stores soon, with Samsung’s Galaxy Fold 5 and Flip 5 to follow. Also interesting are the Nothing Phone (2) and the Pixel 8 phones. And this only scratches the surface of what’s available on Android."
"Toyota plans EV with 1,200-km range that fully charges in 10 mins",2023-06-15T10:47:00.000000000+00:00,"New Delhi - Japanese automotive giant Toyota is planning an EV (electric vehicle) powered by a solid-state battery that would have a range of nearly 1,200 km (750 miles) and a charge time of only 10 minutes.

Saudi Arabia's RVCMC auctions 2.2m carbon credits,2023-06-15T10:45:36.000000000+00:00,"Saudi Arabia's Regional Voluntary Carbon Market Company (RVCMC) said it has held the largest ever auction of voluntary carbon credits at an event in Nairobi, Kenya.
Among the 2.2m credits sold at the auction were ""high-quality Corsia-eligible and Verra-registered carbon credits which can enable buyers operating in a range of industries"", RVCMC said. Corsia is the UN's carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation.
A total of 16 Saudi and international firms participated in the auction, with state-controlled oil giant Saudi Aramco, Saudi Electricity Company and Neom subsidiary ENOWA securing the largest number of credits. Among the other successful bidders were Gulf International Bank, Aramco's base oils subsidiary Luberef and the International Islamic Trade Finance Corporation. The auction clearing price was 23.50 Saudi riyals/t CO2e ($6.80/t).
Rwandan clean cookstoves with 2019-20 vintages made up 34pc of the basket of 2.2m credits, while South African wind with 2018-19 and 2018-20 vintages accounted for a combined 24pc. There were also clean cookstoves from Kenya, Uganda and Burundi, and wind and solar credits from Morocco, Turkey and Egypt.
RVCMC also signed two deals to develop carbon projects in Africa, one in Kenya with battery manufacturer Eveready East Africa and the other in Nigeria with Carbon Vista Nigeria, a joint venture between the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority and trading firm Vitol.
RVCMC was launched in 2022 by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund — the Public Investment Fund (PIF) — and the Saudi Tadawul Group, which runs the kingdom's stock exchange.
RVCMC auctioned 1.4m voluntary carbon credits in October last year. ""Our aim is to be one of the largest voluntary carbon markets in the world by 2030,"" said RVCMC chief executive officer Riham ElGizy."

"Sony still won't put new first-party games on PlayStation Plus day one, says exec",2023-06-15T10:39:59.000000000+00:00,"Sony is confident in its current PlayStation Plus strategy, and has no plans to change it right now.
Speaking with Eurogamer sister site GamesIndustry.biz, PlayStation's head of subscriptions Nick Maguire said putting games on to the service ""a bit later in the life cycle"" is working for Sony. Therefore, this will ""continue to be [its] strategy moving forward.""
""We're happy with our strategy,"" Maguire told the publication. ""Putting games in a bit later in the life cycle has meant that we can reach more customers 12, 18, 24 months after they have released.""
Watch on YouTube
Maguire commented the company has seen its customers get excited about these games' arrival on the subscription service, even though they are not day one releases.
""For us, that's working,"" the Sony exec explained. ""Occasionally, there will be an opportunity to invest in a day-and-date like Stray and we will jump on those when they come in. But for us, letting those [first-party] games go out to the platform outside the service first... that's working and that will continue to be our strategy moving forward.""
This is, of course, a very different approach to Microsoft, which regularly releases new titles on its Game Pass subscription service on the day of their release. This is true for smaller indie games, such as Sea of Stars, or the company's AAA big hitters like Starfield. It is a large part of Game Pass' appeal.
Meanwhile, when asked about Sony's approach to service-based games, Maguire stated the PS Plus team is ""constantly working out what the right strategy is"" while ""keeping close to it and thinking about the role that Plus can play moving forward"".
The exec shared the same response when asked about potentially including a PC offering into its current PS Plus deal, which is again something that Microsoft already does.
Elsewhere in the interview, Maguire shared some interesting PS Plus stats.
According to the exec, PS Plus has seen ""a billion hours of gameplay since that catalogue launched"" last year, with users spending on average seven times as much time on Sony's revamped subscription service than they did with PS Now in the year prior to its launch.
""And that's from a wider, bigger base of players,"" he shared, attributing this success to the ""quality of diversity"" included in the service's portfolio.
""It makes Plus attractive to many people and we've continued to find high quality, high calibre titles. That means that there's something there for nearly everyone.""
As for those titles, Maguire revealed that indie cat game Stray has had the most players of any PS Plus game, while Sucker Punch's Ghost of Tsushima has the highest number of gameplay hours.
""Four of the top ten over the year have been PS Studios titles, whether that's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Horizon Forbidden West and even Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart, which only joined recently - that's climbing very quickly and growing month-on-month. These exclusive titles are really what's resonating. It's bringing people in,"" he shared.
For more on PS Plus, Sony recently revealed its games for June. Additionally, it has shared its plans to add cloud streaming capability to its PlayStation 5 titles. This, the company has said, will make it easier for us all to ""jump into [our] favourite games"" without having to download them.
""Our goal is to add this as an additional benefit to PlayStation Plus Premium as part of our ongoing efforts to enhance the value of PlayStation Plus,"" Sony said, with testing now in the ""early stages""."
NFL player lost $8 million in gambling last year,2023-06-15T10:39:38.000000000+00:00,"Feb 1, 2022; Inglewood, CA, USA; The NFL shield logo is seen at midfield at SoFi Stadium. Super Bowl LVI between the Los Angeles Rams and the Cincinnati Bengals will be played on Feb. 13, 2022. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports
The NFL may be starting to realize that allow players to gamble is not such a good thing.
The NFL recently suspended five players — including four Detroit Lions — for their sports betting activity. An Indianapolis Colts player was also investigated for his “pervasive” sports betting.
But nothing may be worse than one story that is just receiving attention this week.
Pro Football Talk’s Mike Florio reported on Wednesday that one NFL player lost $8 million from gambling in 2022.
Florio did not disclose the identity of the player — it’s possible he wasn’t even told who it was — but that may not be as important as the underlying issue.
Professionally sports leagues used to keep sports betting as far away from the product as possible for integrity purposes. MLB took a particularly strong stance against sports betting (just ask Pete Rose) in response to the Black Sox scandal over 100 years ago. None of the leagues would allow a franchise to be located in Las Vegas. Now all the leagues have not only partnered with sports betting companies, but become investors in them. There are advertisements all over sports leagues promoting wagering, as well as sportsbooks inside stadiums.
We have seen coaches lose jobs, players get suspended, and college athletes investigated over sports betting issues.
Now we’re hearing about an NFL player who lost $8 million.
Charles Barkley has always said that gambling is “not a problem if you can afford it.”
All we can say is that hopefully the player can afford it, because losing that kind of money on gambling is not a good thing, and something that should cause the leagues to reevaluate their stance on sports betting."
2 American Tourists Found Dead Inside Their Luxury Hyatt Hotel Room In Mexico,2023-06-15T10:39:00.000000000+00:00,"Two Americans were found dead in their luxury hotel room in Baja California Sur, Mexico, on Tuesday, New York Post reported.
According to police, paramedics received a report Tuesday that the Americans were unconscious in their room. When they arrived at the Hotel Rancho Pescadero in El Pescadero, around 9 p.m. the two Americans, a man and a woman, had no vital signs.
The pair were pronounced dead at the scene, said police. The suspected cause of death was inhalation of gas, and there were no signs of violence on their bodies.
According to ABC News, the victims have been identified as John Heathco, 41, and Abby Lutz, 22, according to the Baja California Sur Attorney General's Office. Local police initially said both victims were in their mid-30s.
They had been dead for about 10 or 11 hours when they were found, according to the AG's office.
Their cause of death was ""intoxication by a substance to be determined,"" the AG's office said in a statement Wednesday.
Notably, Hotel Rancho Pescadero is a luxury hotel and a Hyatt property.
As per CBS News, there have been several cases of such deaths in Mexico due to poisoning by carbon monoxide or other gases.
In October last year, three Americans visiting Mexico City to celebrate Dia de los Muertos were found dead in their Airbnb rental. The three friends were staying in La Rosita, a neighborhood in the Mexico City borough of Cuajimalpa and close to the upscale Santa Fe business district.
An autopsy report obtained by Bloomberg Wednesday revealed that they likely died from inhaling carbon monoxide fumes. Security guards at the apartment building also had detected an ""intense smell of gas in an apartment""
In Mexico, proper gas line installations, vents, and monitoring devices are often lacking."

Amazon Prime Renews Gender Identity-Themed Series ‘Prisma’,2023-06-15T10:31:56.000000000+00:00,"“Prisma,” the groundbreaking Amazon Italian original series centered around identical adolescent teen twins who challenge gender norms in different ways, has been renewed for a second season.
The second installment of the show is being financed and distributed under a different business model than the first season with Germany’s Beta Film now coming on board as a co-financier and international distributor outside Italy.
Shooting is underway in and around the city of Latina, just south of Rome, on “Prisma” season two with director Ludovico Bessegato back at the helm. Bessegato, who previously gained local prominence as showrunner of “Skam Italia” – the hit Italian adaptation of the Nordic young adult drama – also serves as writer of “Prisma” 2. He is now working with Francesca Scialanca following his collaboration with writer Alice Urciuolo on the first installment that launched last year from the Locarno Film Festival.
The new season of “Prisma” will return to the tales of a group of restless teenagers from Latina, the small town in the Roman province which used to be a swamp until the land was drained under Fascist rule. The area is now known for modernist architecture, fertile agriculture, and a prosperous rural middle class.
“Prisma” 2 will feature the same returning cast, including Mattia Carrano who plays both twins Andrea and Marco. The rest of the ensemble of young rising Italian talents comprises Lorenzo Zurzolo; Caterina Forza; Chiara Bordi; LXX Blood; Matteo Scattaretico; Zakaria Hamza; Riccardo Afan de Rivera Costaguti; Flavia del Prete; Asia Patrignani; Elena Falvella Capodaglio; Andrea Giannini and Nico Guerzoni.
Just like the first season, season two of “Prisma” is produced by Rosario Rinaldo’s Cross Productions for Prime Video. Rosario and Maddalena Rinaldo are producing the second season. Cross Productions – which is owned by Germany’s Beta Film – has now reached a new agreement under which Beta is coming on board as a co-financier.
Under this innovative business model the second season of “Prisma” will go out exclusively on Prime Video only in Italy, while Beta Film will handle international sales in all other territories.
The deal sees Beta Film selling the second season of “Prisma” in all international territories outside Italy and also internationally distributing the second window of the first season of “Prisma,” which plays globally on Amazon, starting from next year.
Cross Productions CEO Rosario Rinaldo in a statement underlined how “An important distribution such as Beta Film now joins the strong collaboration between Prime Video and Cross Productions to handle international sales for this second season of ‘Prisma’ with the aim of reinforcing and supporting the growth of the Italian entertainment industry abroad as well.”
Commented Marco Azzani, country director, Prime Video Italy: “Announcing the second season of such a groundbreaking Italian Original series so beloved by the audience and praised by critics makes us very proud. “Prisma” is a truly diverse show and it represents everything we stand for here at Prime Video in showcasing new voices and talent.”"
"Domino’s Pizza is a buy as new initiatives kick in the second half, Stifel says",2023-06-15T10:31:27.000000000+00:00,"It’s time to buy Domino’s Pizza, according to Stifel. Analyst Chris O’Cull upgraded the pizza delivery giant to buy from hold. He also increased his price target to $350 from $320, implying 14.4% upside from Wednesday’s close. O’Cull thinks that “over the next 12 months, the company will stabilize delivery sales and continue growing carryout sales to new record levels. Better sales performance, lower commodity costs, and higher labor productivity should boost franchisee profitability, sparking greater unit growth.” The analyst pointed out that Domino’s shares have “performed poorly since 2021 as delivery sales have declined.” In that time, the stock is down 20%. DPZ mountain 2020-12-31 DPZ since 2021 O’Cull added that while he does not expect the company’s second-quarter results to show evidence that delivery sales are stabilizing — which would be a “key catalyst” for shares — he sees lower costs providing a boost to near-term earnings as Domino’s introduces new initiatives in the second half of 2023. “Carry-out sales should continue to be a significant growth opportunity,” O’Cull said. “While many investors have focused on the increasing competition for share in food delivery, we believe some may be overlooking the sizable opportunity for Domino’s to grow its market share in the carry-out segment.” New initiative plans for franchisees and a loyalty program and app relaunch later this year should also drive better results, according to Stifel. Domino’s shares were up 2% Thursday during premarket trading. The stock is down more than 11% year to date. —CNBC’s Michael Bloom contributed to this report."

Siemens' new investment plan to create more than a 1000 jobs - CEO,2023-06-15T10:30:00.000000000+00:00,"Siemens’ 2 billion-euro ($2.17 billion) investment plan, announced on Thursday, is more than double the company's cumulative investment spending over the past two years and will create over a thousand jobs, CEO Roland Busch told Reuters.
The head of the German engineering giant, which said it will build new factories, research and development centers and training sites around the world, added that the company would soon announce “a next wave of investments” in Europe and the United States.
Busch told reporters that 1.2 billion euros had already been allocated and the bulk of the remainder will be spent to expand production in Europe and the United States.
“There’s strong demand from the market and that’s why we have to build up to capacity,” Busch said in an interview from Singapore, where Siemens plans to spend 200 million euros on a new plant for its industrial automation division.
Operational from October 2025, the factory will mainly serve Southeast Asian clients, he said, with more investments in the region and India likely once those markets expand.
Busch said that the company had raised its growth targets in all areas in which it is active, without giving details, saying Siemens is ""bullish"".
The company is seeking to diversify its supply chains, but it stressed that Siemens was not seeking any moves away from China.
“We will keep on investing in China, and defending and expanding our market share,” he said, a day after meeting with Chinese Industry Minister Jin Zhuanglong in Beijing.
Siemens also announced on Thursday it was investing 140 million euros to expand its digital factory in Chengdu, China.
He said there is high demand for its automation technology in China and he expects the Chinese market to pick up in the second half of the year.

DHS Cites ‘Privacy Interests’ to Block Release of Prince Harry’s U.S. Visa Records,2023-06-15T10:27:22.000000000+00:00,"The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has cited “privacy interests” in refusing to release the immigration records of Prince Harry as requested by the Heritage Foundation.
DHS senior director Jimmy Wolfrey wrote in a letter to the conservative think tank that “To the extent records exist, this office does not find a public interest in disclosure sufficient to override the subject’s privacy interests,” according to the New York Post.
As Breitbart News reported, a Freedom of Information request had been made seeking release of the duke’s immigration papers amid concerns about how much of his drug use the British Royal revealed to U.S. authorities when he moved to America in February 2020.
U.S. Federal Court to Hear Challenge to Prince Harry’s U.S. Visa over Drug Use Admissions https://t.co/eZDvxdC9BY
— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 5, 2023
Prince Harry made public in his controversial memoir Spare – published in January – he had consumed mushrooms, cocaine and marijuana both in his home country and in California.
These admissions included tales of not just doing lines of cocaine at his elite Eton boarding school and smoking cannabis both there and, as a much older adult, at the Royal residence of Kensington Palace.
Admitting to taking drugs can make moving to the U.S. permanently a difficult – sometimes impossible – task, but the U.S. government did not consider the Heritage Foundation’s request to be valid.
Heritage lawyer Samuel Dewey told the newspaper the reply from DHS “shows an appalling lack of transparency by the Biden Administration.”
“The Department of Homeland Security’s efforts to stonewall the Heritage Foundation’s Freedom of Information request are unacceptable, and we will be contesting their position,” he added.

The Heritage Foundation launched the legal battle against the U.S. government in April this year after it refused to release files relating to Prince Harry’s application for an American visa, as Breitbart London reported.
The filing made reference to “many prominent examples” of celebrities with known drug habits trying to enter the United States in the past.
The list includes Happy Mondays musician Mark Berry who was refused a visa, Libertines Frontman Pete Doherty who was turned around at New York’s JFK airport and put on the next flight home, celebrity chef Nigella Lawson, and perhaps most famously John Lennon of the Beatles.

"H&M, ASOS Shares Jump After Fashion Retailers' Positive Updates Cheer Investors",2023-06-15T10:17:00.000000000+00:00,"STOCKHOLM--Shares in H&M and ASOS were among the biggest gainers in Europe on Thursday as investors rewarded the fashion retailers for positive trading updates.
Sweden's Hennes & Mauritz reported fiscal second-quarter sales that were just shy of expectations as cold weather dented demand, but noted a good start to June, sending shares nearly 7% higher in early trade. Meanwhile, shares in ASOS jumped by almost 16% on Thursday morning after the U.K. online fashion retailer reported a return to profitability and confirmed its guidance.
H&M had cautioned in March that the start of the spring season had been delayed in many of its important markets as a result of the weather, but noted that its collections had been well received in markets where warmer weather had arrived.
For the second quarter, which ended May 31, the Swedish fashion retailer said sales increased by 6% on year to 57.62 billion Swedish kronor ($5.38 billion), versus the SEK58.3 million expected in a FactSet analyst poll, while sales in local currencies were described as ""flattish.""
Although the figures are a clear lag to global peers, the update is a little less downbeat than feared and more seasonal conditions have emerged of late, leading to a good start to the third quarter, analysts at Jefferies said in a note to clients.
""We expect the market to have been anticipating a slightly more downbeat performance than sell-side consensus would suggest,"" they said.
The upbeat market response to H&M's update followed an even bigger move in the shares of ASOS.
The online retailer's adjusted earnings before interest and tax rose by more than 20 million pounds ($25.3 million) on year in the three months ended May 31, putting the group on track to achieve its adjusted EBIT guidance of GBP40 million to GBP60 million in the second half of the year.
Revenue dropped 11% while active customers were down by 800,000 from the end of the previous quarter, but the adjusted gross margin and profit per order both jumped higher, while cost savings are on target.
ASOS has been prioritizing its bottom-line performance over its top line, and shares have suffered steep losses over the past year since the appointment of its new CEO, down 70% until yesterday's close, Interactive Investor's head of investment, Victoria Scholar, said in a note.
""However, shares are soaring today by over 15% with traders and investors encouraged by its realignment towards profitability,"" she said.
In light of today's positive update, there could be some upgrades in the days ahead, Scholar adds.
At 0957 GMT H&M shares were trading 4.3% higher at SEK151.90, while ASOS shares were up 14% at 375.2 pence.

Graco Develops Electric Variable Ratio Metering for 2K Material,2023-06-15T10:15:00.000000000+00:00,"Graco Develops Electric Variable Ratio Metering for 2K Material
EVR™ Allows Manufacturers to Change Ratios Without Changing Equipment
Graco Inc. (NYSE:GGG), a leading manufacturer of fluid handling equipment, introduces the Electric Variable Ratio Metering System. Now available for customization, the EVR™ allows manufacturers to change ratios as they mix, meter and dispense two component (2K) material – all with the same equipment.

“For many industrial manufacturers, honing certain material compositions means putting production on hold to swap out hardware or pumps,” said Robert Delgado, global strategist and product manager for eMobility in Graco’s Industrial Division. “This is especially problematic for electric vehicle (EV) battery assembly and other applications, with constantly changing process requirements and technical specifications.”
While developing EVR technology, Graco also worked with material suppliers about the need to try different ratios and viscosities for research and development purposes, for example, when design engineers write product specifications.
“Whether it’s thermal interface material, epoxy, silicone, urethane or acrylic; two component material uses and requirements are always changing,” said Delgado. “To keep up, manufacturers and suppliers must make adjustments ‘on the fly’ and with minimal capital reinvestment.”
The high flow EVR can move up to 6,400 cubic centimeters (ccs) per minute, while flexing dispense ratios anywhere between 1:1 to 5:1 or 2:1 to 10:1.
When it’s time to try different material, the EVR’s base purge feature conserves the amount of solvent used to clean out the system by independently driving either material side. It also keeps old material from curing, so that there’s no need to replace a static or dynamic mixer because of fast curing materials or intermittent production runs.

New York Mets pitcher Drew Smith suspended for 10 games after apparent use of sticky substance,2023-06-15T10:14:29.000000000+00:00,"CNN —
New York Mets pitcher Drew Smith has been given a 10-game suspension following his ejection on Tuesday for the apparent use of a sticky substance on his hands.
Michael Hill, MLB’s Senior Vice President of On-Field Operations, announced the decision which also includes an undisclosed fine for violating the prohibitions on foreign substances.
Players are permitted to use sweat and rosin on their hands, but too much of either substance is illegal in the MLB and could lead to an ejection.
New York Mets pitcher Max Scherzer ejected from Los Angeles Dodgers game after umpire inspections for sticky hands
Smith told reporters after the game that he had used the same amount of rosin he usually does and has experienced no other issues so far this season.
“My hands weren’t sticky,” Smith said. “The process is so arbitrary. It can change from one crew to the other. I think that’s the main issue. It just sucks for the team not having a guy for 10 days.”
In 2021, MLB introduced a new rule that meant players ejected due to sticky substances can be suspended for 10 days.
Smith’s Mets teammate Max Scherzer was ejected for the same reason earlier this season.
“We’re all angry about this one,” Scherzer told reporters after the game. “If you feel his hand, you don’t feel anything.”
Smith was stopped for a routine check in the seventh innings of the Mets’ 7-6 loss to the New York Yankees on Tuesday, before having his hands checked by all four umpires.
According to MLB.com, crew chief Bill Miller told reporters: “I don’t know what it [the substance] was, I just know it was sticky.”
The Mets will not be able to replace Smith for the 10-game stretch, according to MLB rules."
Bitcoin Halving History Provides Little Guidance on Outcome: Coinbase,2023-06-15T10:13:00.000000000+00:00,"It is possible that the next bitcoin (BTC) halving, expected in second-quarter 2024, will have a positive impact on the cryptocurrency’s performance, but that’s not a foregone conclusion, Coinbase (COIN) said in a report Wednesday.
“Getting a clear picture of how markets reacted to previous bitcoin halving episodes requires disentangling the effect of liquidity, rates and U.S. dollar movements,” analyst David Duong wrote.
The halving of the block reward is often viewed positively because it enhances bitcoin’s “prospective scarcity” and supports its supply/demand dynamics, the note said. When bitcoin halving occurs, rewards are cut by 50%.
Still, with only three recorded halving events in the past, evidence of how markets react is limited, the note added. It is difficult to see a clear pattern, particularly as the events were “contaminated by factors like global liquidity measures,” the report said.
Coinbase says global liquidity appears to have peaked in the near term, noting that there's still another 9-10 months till the next halving, “which makes it unclear what the net effect on bitcoin’s price behavior might be.”
Retail demand for the largest cryptocurrency is likely to remain strong ahead of the event, according to Wall Street giant JPMorgan (JPM).

EE rolls out fastest broadband yet with speeds up to 1.6 Gbps,2023-06-15T10:10:33.000000000+00:00,"EE has announced its fastest home broadband yet, with a Full Fibre 1.6 Gbps service rolling out to UK homes this summer.
The new broadband will be built on a gigabit+ capable full fibre network, with EE claiming it will provide average speeds that are 44x faster than Superfast Fibre.
EE hasn’t specified pricing for this new broadband service just yet, and has said more details will be revealed in “due course”. But you can register your interest to be notified of availability as soon as possible via their official website.
EE will also be launching new routers alongside its Full Fibre 1.6 Gbps service, including the Smart Hub Plus, which EE calls its most advanced router yet. With this new router, EE promises “best in class Wi-FI controls” allowing the user to prioritise bandwidth for specific devices and set parental controls so your children aren’t playing online games way past bedtime.
The new Smart Hybrid Connect will also become available this summer, which can work with the latest Smart Hubs to provide a backup internet connection to EE’s mobile network if your home broadband ever shuts down. Other new hardware options from EE include the Smart Hub and Smart Wi-Fi.
All of the new products will be made from up to 95% recycled plastic, with EE also confirming it will use recycled materials for its box packaging.
EE’s CEO, Marc Allera said: “As we create the UK’s most personal customer-focused brand, we continually look to bring truly innovative products and services to market to help our customers manage their increasingly busy households.”
“Whether it be working from home, gaming, or juggling the increasingly digital elements of everyday life – EE home broadband backed-up by EE’s award-winning mobile network will set the standard for broadband for years to come, offering customers the best experience and putting them in control of their home connectivity.”

Uber driver shot while driving passenger in North Philadelphia,2023-06-15T10:08:00.000000000+00:00,"Police are investigating after an Uber driver was shot while driving as passenger in North Philadelphia, authorities say. FOX 29's Steve Keeley has the details."
Marian Ilitch ranks eighth on Forbes' list of richest self-made women list,2023-06-15T10:07:00.000000000+00:00,"A Michigan businesswoman beat out the likes of Oprah Winfrey, Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg, Rihanna and Kim Kardashian on Forbes' recently released America’s Richest Self-Made Women list.
Marian Ilitch, founder and chairwoman of Ilitch Holdings Inc., is the only Michigan resident on the list, ranking eighth with a net worth of $4 billion. The list ranks 100 women who are cumulatively worth a record $124 billion, Forbes said, up nearly 12% from a year ago.
Building supply distributor Diane Hendricks ranked first for the sixth year in a row, with a $15 billion net worth, Forbes said. Also on the list are Elaine Wynn, who co-founded Wynn Resorts with her then-husband Steve Wynn; Sara Blakely, the founder of Spanx, and the fashion designer Tory Burch.
Ilitch, 90, has been on Forbes' America's Richest Self-Made Women list consistently over the last several years and topped the list in 2017, according to news reports at the time. Forbes said to be eligible for the list, women have to have substantially made their own fortunes in the U.S. and/or be U.S. citizens or permanent residents, according to an explanation of its methodology on its list from last year. To compile net worth, Forbes valued individual assets including stakes in public companies and valued private companies by consulting with outside experts.
How did Marian Ilitch make her fortune?
Ilitch is a first-generation American, the daughter of Macedonian immigrants. She got her start in the food business as a young girl filling napkin containers and salt and pepper shakers in her father’s restaurant, according to her biography on Ilitch Holdings' website, and graduated from Fordson High School in Dearborn.
After her third child was born, Marian and her husband, Mike, who died in 2017, opened a single Little Caesars pizza shop in Garden City, Michigan, in 1959. Little Caesars is now the third-largest pizza chain in the world, with stores in each of the 50 U.S. states and in more than 27 countries around the world.
Together, Mike and Marian purchased the Detroit Red Wings, Detroit Tigers and the Fox Theatre.
Marian invested in Detroit’s MotorCity Casino in 1999 and in 2005 became sole owner of the casino. In 2021, the Ilitch family organization purchased half of Atlantic City’s Ocean Casino Resort.

Who is running the Ilitch family organization today?
Mike and Marian's son Chris Ilitch runs the day-to-day operations of Ilitch Holdings as its president and CEO. Under that umbrella are Little Caesars, Blue Line Foodservice Distribution, the Detroit Red Wings, the Detroit Tigers, Olympia Development and the live entertainment company 313 Presents, among other companies.
Olympia Development of Michigan, in partnership with New York megadeveloper Stephen Ross' The Related Cos., is in the midst of a development project called District Detroit, which calls for 10 new or rehabilitated buildings in and around downtown Detroit, including 1.2 million square feet of new office space, nearly 700 new apartments and two new hotels.

Deutsche Bank Says Trading Revenue to Drop as Much as 20%,2023-06-15T10:06:00.000000000+00:00,"Deutsche Bank AG expects trading revenue to decline by as much as a fifth this quarter, the first major European investment bank to warn of a significant slowdown.
Fixed income trading will drop 15% to 20% compared with the bumper quarter a year earlier, when it rose more than 30%, Chief Financial Officer James von Moltke said Thursday. Analysts were expecting a decline of about 12%.
“We are seeing the trail-off in macro, but actually still quite encouraging activity despite all the things we’ve been through - debt ceiling and what have you,” von Moltke said at an investor conference hosted by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in Paris. “But compared to this outstanding” period last year, “we’re naturally going to have a step-back.”
The German lender joins Wall Street firms in flagging weaker debt trading, as interest rates near their peak and the economy is likely to enter a recession. JPMorgan Chase & Co. expects revenue from investment banking and trading to each decline 15% from a year ago, and Goldman Sachs has warned of a slump in trading that could exceed 25%. Bank of America Corp. expects its traders to be roughly flat.
Deutsche Bank's Trading Unit Is Shrinking
The lender is guiding for another quarterly drop after strong growth last year
Source: Company filings, investor call
Note: 2Q 2023 is average of company guidance for 15-20% drop
A drop of as much as 20% would continue a trend that started in the first quarter, when Deutsche Bank reported 17% lower fixed income revenue. The lender in April announced plans to cut about 800 senior back-office staff as Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing steps up cost reductions in response.
The trading slowdown is driven by weaker demand for products that allow investors to bet on interest rate or foreign exchange movements, von Moltke said. Overall, however, the environment for banking isn’t all bad, he said, with asset prices holding up.
While trading revenue is down, higher interest rates have fueled income at the corporate and private banking units that were at the center of Sewing’s strategic revamp four years ago. Von Moltke said that tailwind continues, even as the positive effect from higher rates has peaked.
The bank has previously said it expects to make about €28.5 billion ($30.9 billion) in total revenue this year, which would be an increase of about 5% on last year. Von Moltke said the shifting revenue mix — from the investment bank to the retail and commercial lending units — is positive because it shows that the more stable businesses become more important."

EE announces fastest broadband in the UK,2023-06-15T10:04:32.000000000+00:00,"It’s been a busy week for mobile networks in the UK this week. Hot on the heels of Vodafone and Three announcing their plans to merge, which would result in them becoming the largest mobile network in the country, the current largest network EE has revealed its fastest broadband to date – plus new hardware.
During its new flagship store opening, EE Studio in London – which is surprisingly cool – the company highlighted plans for a new range of supercharged home broadband services. The Full Fibre 1.6Gbps broadband offering will arrive to homes nationwide later this summer, alongside Hub Plus and Smart Hybrid Connect and EE has said it’s the fastest broadband offering in the country.
POCKET-LINT VIDEO OF THE DAYSCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT
Currently, the fastest broadband in the UK is offered by Virgin Media with its Gig1 Fibre Broadband, which claims 1.13Gbps download speeds. Using EE’s new 1.6Gbps, you’d be able to download a 2-hour 4K movie (all 28GB of it) in about 2 minutes and 20 seconds. Or to put it another way, the 4.7GB of data a DVD will hold, could be downloaded in 23 seconds. That’s also going to appeal to those wanting to download games for the Xbox, for example, which sometimes drags on for ages.
The Full Fibre 1.6Gbps broadband is being introduced to try and deliver the “best in-home connectivity”. Getting geeky for just a second, the Full Fibre 1.6Gpbs service is built on a Gigabit+ capable full fibre network that uses a 1.8Gbps product in order to deliver those 1.6Gpbs speeds to your home. EE is claiming the service will offer seamless connectivity and extra capacity for more devices. It’s also said that it will deliver average speeds up to 44 times faster than the company’s SuperFast Fibre option.
EE
The Smart Hub Plus router that launches alongside the broadband offering is the company’s most advanced router to date and it will run on a new firmware platform built by EE. This platform will offer new Wi-Fi controls designed to improve your experience. Some of these controls include the ability to prioritise bandwidth when you’re working from home or gaming, as well as set advanced parental controls. Google Nest Wifi allows you to prioritise devices, which comes in very useful, especially during busy times. The Smart Hub Plus router will also pair with Smart Wi-Fi Plus, that is designed to connect all corners in your home and it is also made from 95 per cent recycled plastics.
Alongside the new broadband and hardware announcements, and the flagship store that not only has a gaming section but a Digital Spa too, there is a Smart Hub and Smart Wi-Fi offering joining the Smart Hub Plus and Smart Wi-Fi Plus to replace EE’s current portfolio. These will offering a couple of extra features like Digital Voice. All will support Smart Hybrid Connect, which enables EE’s broadband services to connect to EE’s mobile network as a back-up if needed, but if you want the 1.6Gpbs speeds from the new broadband, you will need the Smart Hub Plus router.
Pricing and availability of the Full Fibre 1.6Gbps service and range of hardware has yet to be revealed but we will update this piece once we hear how much the fastest broadband offering in the UK will set you back. It will be available nationwide wherever Full Fibre is available EE told us during the EE Studio launch. It’s said to hit around 10 million homes.

"Bank of America expects Fed to deliver two more rate hikes, JP Morgan adds July hike expectation",2023-06-15T10:03:40.000000000+00:00,"June 15 (Reuters) - BofA Global Research now expects two more quarter percentage point interest rate hikes from the U.S. Federal Reserve this year, while JP Morgan sees one more hike in July, after the central bank signaled further raises may be needed.
BofA's new terminal rate forecast stands 5.5%-5.75%, it said in a note on Wednesday. It had earlier expected the terminal rate to be held at the current 5%-5.25% range. JP Morgan sees the rate peaking at 5.25%-5.50%.

The change in forecasts come after the Fed kept its key rate unchanged in the 5%-5.25% range on Wednesday, but signaled two more hikes might be needed in 2023 to tame inflation. The Fed has increased rates by 500 basis points (bps) since starting its tightening cycle in March last year.
BofA expects the central bank to deliver the hikes in July and September this year.
Citigroup moved its June hike expectation to September and maintained its terminal rate expectation of 5.5%-5.75%. Goldman Sachs held its forecast for one more hike in July.

""We think the (Fed's) hint at an every-other-meeting pace means that the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) is more likely to consider a possible second hike in November than in September,"" Goldman economists said.
Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, sees no more hikes and expects the Fed to hold the rate at 5.1% till it undertakes a 25 bps cut in March 2024.
BofA pushed its rate-cut expectation to May 2024, from an earlier expectation of a cut in March."
"Zee Entertainment case: SAT seeks SEBI response in 48 hours to Punit Goenka's appeal, decision likely on Monday",2023-06-15T10:03:00.000000000+00:00,"The Securities Appellate Tribunal declined to pass an interim order in the Zee Entertainment case on Thursday and asked SEBI to file a response within 48 hours. The SAT will now hear the case on Monday and take a decision. Meanwhile, the National Company Law Tribunal is slated to hear an application for the planned Zee-Sony merger on Friday.
Managing Director Punit Goenka had reportedly filed an appeal against the recent SEBI order banning him and Essel Group chairman Subhash Chandra from holding any directorial or key management position. According to reports the next hearing will take place on June 19.
Earlier this week, India’s capital markets regulator said the Mumbai-based media house faked the recovery of loans to cover for private financing deals by its founder. SEBI alleged that the company funneled money through several entities to make it seem like it had recovered money owed by Chandra’s private entities. The founder and his son, Punit Goenka — Zee’s chief executive — “abused their position"" and siphoned off funds “for their own benefit"" it said in an interim order.
Following the development a Bloomberg report had quoted analysts to predict that the planned merger was likely to face further delay. Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd is hoping for a merger with a subsidiary of Sony Group Corp. The merger is aimed at creating a $10 billion media giant with the financial muscle to challenge online streaming platforms such as Netflix Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Walt Disney Co. in India.
The merger had been approved by Zee’s shareholders and India’s antitrust regulator last year. It was initially hobbled by a courtroom feud between Zee’s founders and its largest shareholder, then subsequently by an insolvency case filed against Zee that was halted in February.

Ryanair warning for anyone travelling to Spain as airline ban popular item,2023-06-15T10:03:00.000000000+00:00,"has enforced a new ban for anyone flying to a number of popular Spanish holiday destinations.
The budget airline has enacted restrictions for passengers travelling from the UK to Ibiza, Alicante, Barcelona, Malaga, Palma and Tenerife South. Customers heading to these hotspots with the airline are now banned from carrying alcohol on board, the Liverpool Echo reports.
All passengers' carry-on luggage will be searched prior to boarding and any alcohol purchased at the airport will be marked and will be stored in the aircraft hold until landing. However, anyone caught trying to sneak booze on board could be kicked off their flight with no refund.
The company said that the restriction has been enacted to ""prioritize the comfort and safety of all passengers"". Spanish officials previously announced a number of extra enforcements would be taken to ""crack down"" on misbehaving tourists.
In an email to passengers with bookings, Ryanair warned : ""Customers will not be allowed to carry alcohol on board and all cabin baggage will be searched at the boarding gates.
""Any alcohol purchased in airport shops or elsewhere must be packed carefully in a suitable item of cabin baggage, which will be tagged at the gate and then placed in the aircraft hold free of charge if you have purchased priority boarding or have a small piece of hand luggage.""
Similar rules to ensure safe alcohol consumption are in place at a number of Spanish resorts. Anyone with an all-inclusive booking in areas such as Magalluf, El Arenal, Playa de Palma in Mallorca and Sant Antoni in Ibiza, will only be allowed six alcoholic drinks each day.
On May 1, cops in Palma, Majorca ""stepped up"" security measures to improve safety for both tourists and residents against anti-social behaviour. Such enforcements include heavy fines for public intoxication and penalties for pubs and other venues who ignore laws relating to excess alcohol sales.

EU told to slash greenhouse gas emissions 90-95% by 2040,2023-06-15T10:01:45.000000000+00:00,"BRUSSELS — The European Union (EU) should commit to slash its net greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 95% by 2040, official advisers said on Thursday, as Brussels prepares a new goal to curb Europe’s contribution to climate change.
The European Commission is drafting what would be the EU’s first legally binding emissions-cutting target for 2040, aimed at guiding the world’s third-biggest economy towards its aim to have zero net emissions by 2050.
The EU’s advisory board on climate change said the goal should be a 90% to 95% cut in net emissions by 2040, compared with 1990 levels.
“The pathways and other analysis indicate numerous potential benefits to climate action — better air quality, better health outcomes, [becoming] less dependent on imported fossil fuels, less water stress,” said Ottmar Edenhofer, who chairs the 15-member board of independent scientific experts.
The advisers assessed more than 1,000 emissions scenarios, to make a recommendation consistent with the Paris Agreement’s goal to limit global warming to 1.5C — the level that would avert its worst climate impacts.
The advisors said reaching the 2040 goal would require a massive scale up of renewable energy, a shift to electrify polluting industries, and replacing fossil fuels with alternatives like hydrogen. Coal use in the power sector would be virtually eliminated by 2030, followed by gas power in 2040.
Methods to remove CO2 from the atmosphere — through technologies or natural methods like trees — would need scaling up, but the advisors said the majority of the target should be met by reducing emissions outright.
The EU has among the most ambitious climate change policies of any major economy, having passed a raft of laws to deliver its 2030 target to cut net emissions by 55%, from 1990 levels.
But the advisors said even their recommended 2040 target would fall short of what should be the EU’s “fair” contribution to meeting global climate goals, considering Europe’s high per-capita historical emissions compared with poorer nations.
To address this fairness gap, EU countries should support other countries to cut their emissions, while slashing its own, the advisers said.
A European Commission spokesperson said the recommendation would feed into its own assessment of the 2040 target, which is due early next year. — Reuters"
Philips Kitchen Appliances unveils its campaign Chatkare,2023-06-15T10:01:00.000000000+00:00,"Philips has launched its latest campaign, “Chatkare”, to encourages viewers to embrace cooking. The ad depicts moments of happiness, love, and friendship while showing the usefulness of Philips’ cutting-edge line of kitchen appliances in everyday life.
The film captures cultural and social nuances from different zones, showcasing a young expecting couple enjoying home-cooked golgappe during a rainy day, while another couple secretly relishing the crisp, golden brown vada in their kitchen. Followed by a Parsi uncle becoming the hero of the neighbourhood, treating kids to ice gola made using the Phillips Mixer Grinder.
Commenting on the new campaign, Pooja Baid, marketing head, Philips Domestic Appliances India Ltd, said, “Chatkare campaign aims to celebrate cooking as a joyful everyday experience and food as a medium to bond with your loved ones. It also celebrates the “Me” time that the consumers get by cooking different culinary delights with Philips Kitchen appliances.”
Additionally, the campaign is conceptualised by Ogilvy India.
“When conceptualising this campaign for today’s generation, we wanted to demonstrate the joy of cooking that Philips brings to every Indian household. The jingle captures how we are always looking for a moment of chatkare and Swanand’s voice just adds magic to those moments. Each instance has been chosen to perfectly convey the message of “jab chahein khushiyan pakayein,” Ritu Sharda, CCO, Ogilvy India (North) added.
The campaign breaks with a long-format digital film and extends to TV, cinema as well as social media platforms."
Forget BT! New broadband from EE makes its rivals look embarrassingly slow,2023-06-15T10:01:00.000000000+00:00,"EE is launching a speedy new broadband that will blast a full HD movie to TVs in just 20 seconds.
11:01, Thu, Jun 15, 2023 | UPDATED: 11:10, Thu, Jun 15, 2023
BT broadband users might fancy making a simple switch over to EE in the coming months. The popular UK mobile network, which is actually part of the BT group, has just announced the launch of a speedy service that will leave its rivals for dust. The new plan, which looks set to arrive in the summer, will offer consumers the chance to get broadband whizzed into their homes at speeds over 1.5Gbps.
To put that into some perspective, the current UK average is around 72Mbps making EE’s offering over 20 times faster.
With 1.6Gbps installed, users can expect to see a full Hollywood blockbuster downloaded in just 20 seconds. The same HD film beamed to tellies using a standard connection would take around 10 minutes.
Along with being much, much faster, EE is also promising that subscribers will get a boost to their Wi-Fi router thrown in as well. Called the Smart Hub Plus, this device includes clever tech to make sure that all-important Wi-Fi reaches every corner of homes.
Smart Hybrid Connect can also be added which will keep users connected even if the fixed-line broadband goes offline. That’s thanks to the system automatically switching over to EE’s 4G to keep homes connected during outages.
EE hasn’t disclosed pricing but Express.co.uk expects this 1.6Gbps plan to be over £60 per month. Hopefully, EE will reveal a release date and full pricing soon.
Speaking about the launch Marc Allera, CEO at EE said “As we create the UK’s most personal customer-focused brand, we continually look to bring truly innovative products and services to market to help our customers manage their increasingly busy households. Whether it be working from home, gaming, or juggling the increasingly digital elements of everyday life – EE home broadband backed-up by EE’s award-winning mobile network will set the standard for broadband for years to come, offering customers the best experience and putting them in control of their home connectivity.”
Along with that ludicrously quick broadband, EE has also unveiled a new flagship store.
The retail space, which opens its doors on Friday 16th June, includes a Welcome Zone, Digital Spa to help consumers with their well-being and a Gaming Zone to experience the latest titles."

2024 VW T-Cross Spied Completely Undisguised Looking More Like A Baby T-Roc,2023-06-15T10:00:00.000000000+00:00,"It seems that VW engineers got fed up with wrapping up the T-Cross, as a prototype of the small SUV was caught testing in Europe without disguise.
The T-Cross was originally introduced in 2018 as the smallest member of VW’s SUV range. A mid-lifecycle update is expected later this year, with prototypes making their spy debut in February 2023. The latest sighting however is the most revealing, exposing all of the styling updates.
More: 2024 VW Golf Spied With Minimum Camo Showing Its Redesigned Face
The redesigned face of the T-Cross makes it look more like the slightly larger T-Roc, thanks to the rounded bumper intakes and the wider grille with a single chrome bar in the middle. The lower bumper intake is also larger and is surrounded by aluminum-style trim reminiscent of a skid plate. Finally, the headlights have new LED graphics and appear to be smoked, inspired by the flagship Touareg.
The profile is carried over as with the majority of the rear end, although a closer look reveals the slightly redesigned bumper. There is black tape covering a portion of the taillights which are expected to gain fresh LED graphics, and the rear skid plate which will likely inherit a greater dose of aluminum-style trim mirroring the changes up front.
The dashboard of the prototype appears to be covered, hinting at interior updates. If VW wants to keep up with the fierce competition, they will probably improve the perceived quality of the materials which is one of the weaknesses of the current T-Cross, following the example of the facelifted T-Roc. It is also safe to assume that the SUV will get fresh infotainment software for its digital cockpit.

The powertrain lineup will most likely be carried over with minor updates. Options include the entry-level three-cylinder 1.0 TSI in two power outputs and the four-cylinder 1.5 TSI which will likely be upgraded to the Evo2 specification. VW could also add 48-Volt mild-hybrid technology to the petrol engines, something that is already happening in the rest of the lineup. All variants of the T-Cross will be FWD, with either a manual or a DSG automatic gearbox.
The fact that Volkswagen doesn’t bother camouflaging the facelifted T-Cross likely means that the official debut is just around the corner. Rivals in the B-SUV segment include the likes of the Skoda Kamiq, Renault Captur, Peugeot 2008, and Ford Puma, all of which are expected to return updated for 2024.

Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Slams SEC’s ‘Flawed’ Plan For Exchange Registration,2023-06-15T10:00:00.000000000+00:00,"Coinbase has taken a defiant stance against the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s proposed definition change. In a bold move, Paul Grewal, the company’s chief legal officer, has accused the regulator of preemptively imposing its authority and basing its proposed rules on unsubstantiated assumptions about cryptocurrency jurisdiction.
This clash between Coinbase and the SEC highlights the growing tension between the cryptocurrency industry and regulatory bodies, igniting a fervent debate about the future of digital assets.
As Coinbase challenges the SEC’s proposed rules, it raises important questions about the balance between innovation and regulation in the evolving world of cryptocurrencies.
Coinbase Challenges SEC’s Proposed Definition Change
In a series of tweets , Grewal vehemently criticized the SEC’s proposal, arguing that it was “too flawed on process and substance to move forward.” At the heart of the dispute lies the SEC’s intention to extend the application of securities laws, as specified in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 , to decentralized exchanges (DEXs), treating them similarly to centralized securities exchanges.
Yesterday we filed a comment letter on the @SECGov proposed rule that seeks to expand the definition of exchange to include DEXs. Tl; dr: this proposal should NOT be adopted, and certainly not before completing the threshold steps for any rulemaking. 1/11 https://t.co/fBXAYiWb4W
— paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) June 14, 2023
Grewal firmly expressed his belief that the SEC’s attempt to impose the same registration requirements on DEXs as those applied to national securities exchanges is fundamentally “impossible.” He contended that such a requirement contradicts the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act , which governs the rulemaking process of federal agencies.
Furthermore, Grewal argued that the SEC cannot evade its obligation to conduct economic analysis simply by asserting the lack of available economic data, especially when relevant data already exists.
Paradigm Joins Coinbase In Urging SEC To Reconsider Redefinition
Coinbase’s strong opposition to the SEC’s proposed definition change is finding support from other prominent voices within the cryptocurrency industry. Paradigm, a crypto liquidity network, has also expressed its dissatisfaction with the SEC’s move and has called for the withdrawal of the proposed redefinition.
In a letter to the SEC , Paradigm argued that decentralized exchanges (DEXs), particularly those utilizing automated market maker mechanisms, operate without any intermediating entity or individual between buyers and sellers.
Instead, these DEXs rely on algorithms to maintain balanced pools of cryptoassets, accessible to potential buyers and sellers. Paradigm emphasized that this key distinction renders the SEC’s proposed application of traditional securities exchange regulations to DEXs impractical and inappropriate.
With this in mind, Paradigm urged the SEC to withdraw its proposed redefinition of the term “exchange” and instead embark on a fresh consideration of how to adapt regulations in the context of decentralized finance (DeFi). The letter called for a rigorous economic analysis, genuine and extensive engagement with the industry, and a close examination of the statutory jurisdiction limits faced by the SEC.
As Coinbase and Paradigm unite in their criticism of the SEC’s proposed rule change , the debate surrounding the regulation of decentralized exchanges and the broader DeFi landscape intensifies.

Official: Volkswagen Arteon Dead At The End Of 2024,2023-06-15T10:00:00.000000000+00:00,"Despite VW’s best efforts, the Arteon never caught on in America, with sales only peaking at 5,537 in 2021. This pales in comparison to the brand’s best seller that year. Over the same period, VW sold 109,744 Tiguans. Despite the Arteon’s good looks and potent powertrain, people seem only to have eyes for crossovers and SUVs these days.
The Arteon is also oddly placed from a pricing perspective. It’s roughly $10,000 more than a Toyota Camry but cheaper than slightly larger cars like the BMW 5 Series and Audi A6. We think the $10k over a Camry is undoubtedly justified, given the stunning looks, generous standard features, and a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-pot that produces 300 hp and 295 lb-ft of torque.
It has always been a bit of a left-field choice, very much like the Kia Stinger, which will be culled by the end of this year."

Google says the update will add more flexibility and control over the layout of text with tables in Docs, letting you craft your documents just how you like.
Google Docs tables
While Google Workspace includes its own in , many people prefer to use Docs to add inline tables to their documents.
The new changes will primarily allow users to drag tables in a document and place them exactly where you want, giving much improved customization.
The update will automatically wrap the contents of your document around the table, but you can also customize this by choosing the wrap direction (left, right or even both sides) as well as the specifying margin from the surrounding text.
Users will also be able to set a fixed position for a table on a page , and Google Docs will also now provide quick layouts to instantly move a table to a preset position on a page.
In a bid to improve cross-platform usability, Google Docs has also improved how it works when importing and exporting Microsoft Word documents with tables, so your documents remain consistent.
This new update is rolling out now and will be available to all Google Workspace customers and users with personal Google Accounts.

European Commission approves Government supported semiconductor investment,2023-06-15T09:57:40.000000000+00:00,"FANFARE is part of a new European Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI) in the area of microelectronics and communication technologies. IPCEI are a State Aid tool that facilitate large-scale cross-border projects that significantly benefit the EU and help achieve the twin digital and green transitions by investing in breakthrough innovation and infrastructure. They combine both public and private knowledge and resources from across Europe to support projects where the technological or financial risk is too great for one company or Member State alone.
Ireland is one of 14 Member States with direct participants in this IPCEI on Microelectronics and Communication Technologies (IPCEI ME/CT), with a further 5 Member States plus Norway also involved in the project. A total of 68 projects from 56 companies form this IPCEI ME/CT. The participating Member States will provide up to €8.1 billion in funding in the coming years, which is expected to unlock an additional €13.7bn in private investments.
Simon Coveney TD, Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, said of the decision: “My Department warmly welcomes the European Commission’s approval of Ireland’s participation in the IPCEI on Microelectronics and Communications Technologies. The Irish semiconductor industry has grown deep roots over 45 years and this is an opportunity for Ireland to contribute to the development of European capacity and capability in increasingly vital frontier technologies.”
The IPCEI ME/CT, which is the first IPCEI in which Ireland is directly participating, addresses the technological performance, sustainability and societal challenges of the next decade and is expected to result in a clear innovation advantage for Europe. The IPCEI ME/CT will connect a thriving ecosystem of innovative start-ups, SMEs, large enterprises, and research organisations from across the EU, with collaboration between participants a key element of the IPCEI. Indeed, the Irish participant, Analog Devices Inc. from Limerick will collaborate with several new partners from other Member States on their project but also on the projects of other companies.
Semiconductor chips are ubiquitous in our daily lives, and they are needed in almost every vital sector and service. They have critical application for health, energy, communications, and automation and as such, are central to the European Union’s digital and green transitions. Ireland has a significant semiconductor design and fabrication history, and we have developed a strong domestic and international semiconductor industry and R&D ecosystem, with over 130 indigenous and foreign subsidiary companies across the microelectronics value chain.
Ireland’s participation in the IPCEI ME/CT is an example of our ability and commitment to play our part in realising the ambitions of the EU, outlined in the European Chips Act, to strengthen our capacity and capability in semiconductor production.

Skates are High! Zeel's Funky New TVC Showcases its Next-gen Rainwear,2023-06-15T09:55:00.000000000+00:00,"NewsVoirMumbai (Maharashtra) [India], June 15: At the crack of the monsoons hitting several parts of India, Zeel Rainwear, the country's number one rainwear brand has launched its new TVC campaign. The new campaign showcases the new generation of rainwear, designed with the ever moving citizen in mind.
Over the years, Zeel Rainwear has soared its way to the top of the category, and it has done so by developing products focused on the core needs of consumers, i.e. staying dry even in extreme rain conditions. Zeel's erstwhile campaign 'Sada Sukhe Raho' anchored on this benefit.
Commenting on the campaign, Rohit Trivedi - Director, Zeel Rainwer, said, ""We at Zeel believe in making products which add value to our consumers' lives. We Indians often commute in extreme rains to go about our everyday routines, many by riding two-wheelers or wading through traffic on foot. Regular rainwear brands tend to obstruct mobility, and we have constantly innovated to design our new generation of rainwear that enhances mobility. This season, we have pushed the bar by bringing innovative features such as withstanding 10,000 mm of water pressure, water repellent coating for quick drying and specially crafted air vents to keep our everyday warriors cool and dry on the move.""Conceptualized by Alpha1, a young boutique agency based out of Mumbai, the TVC is a 30-second film featuring a skating enthusiast effortlessly cruising through the rain, donning Zeel rainwear. Gliding his way through everyday obstacles like potholes and puddles, heavy trafficrain, the skater demonstrates gravity defying moves, flaunting the rainwear's design focus on mobility.
Commenting on the campaign, Dorothy Rebello - Co-founder, Alpha1, says ""Our task was to deliver two things - introduce the new range of rainwear which is designed for mobilitysay this in 10 seconds - as the 10-second edit would run the most to achieve media efficiency! After looking at the products, it was instinctive that we had to showcase the product by virtue of a demo. A skater on in the Mumbai rains wearing rainwear is a amusing visual, with an ability to stand out in media clutter. I'm glad we've been able to deliver this crisp message in 10 seconds while keeping the TVC charm in the 30 second version.""Link to the campaign :Zeel Rainwear is part of NZ Seasonal Wear Private Limited established in 1995, pioneers in developing climate wear for every season be it rains, winter or summers.

"Alibaba aims to expand local business in Europe, president says",2023-06-15T09:52:00.000000000+00:00,"PARIS (Reuters) -Alibaba Group will make Europe top priority as it focuses on building local businesses and online platforms outside China, the president of the e-commerce giant said on Thursday.
""What we will focus more for the future is to build local businesses, so you will see something called TMall which we have in China become TMall in Europe, which means we will serve local brands and local customers in local markets,"" J. Michael Evans told a technology conference in Paris.
""We have started with a pilot project in Spain which we will expand across Europe,"" he said.
Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) announced in March it would split into six units and explore fundraising or listings for most of them, following a two-year regulatory crackdown on China's tech sector.
Its e-commerce business is to be split, with one side covering Alibaba's domestic-facing e-commerce marketplaces and the other its overseas e-commerce marketplaces such as Lazada, which serves Southeast Asia, and AliExpress.
Taobao and TMall are China's dominant e-commerce marketplaces in China.
Asked about Alibaba founder Jack Ma, China's best known entrepreneur who withdrew from public view in late 2020 after giving a speech criticising China's regulatory system, he said Ma remained Alibaba's biggest shareholder and still cared very much about the company.
Ma left mainland China in late 2021 for stints in Japan, Spain, Australia and Thailand, according to photographs, but returned in March a day before Alibaba announced its restructuring. He has not made any public comments during that period.
""Jack is alive, he is well, he is happy. He is teaching at a university in Tokyo and spending more time in China,"" Evans said.
""He is the largest shareholder at Alibaba. This is his company, he cares as much about this company today as he did when he started it and I expect this to continue for as long as Alibaba and Jack Ma are here."""
Australian opposition party expels senator over sexual misconduct allegations,2023-06-15T09:51:00.000000000+00:00,"CANBERRA, Australia — Australia’s main opposition party expelled a senator on Thursday after a female senator accused him of sexual assault in the latest evidence of a toxic culture in Parliament House that is hostile to women.

Opposition leader Peter Dutton said he expelled Sen. David Van from the conservative Liberal Party following allegations made in Parliament on Wednesday night by independent Sen. Lidia Thorpe of harassment and sexual assault. Van remains a senator, but no longer represents the Liberal Party.
Van denied the allegations, which were made under parliamentary privilege, under which no one can be sued for defamation over anything said in the Senate.
Political leaders apologized last year to staffers who have endured decades of bullying, harassment and sexual assault inside Parliament House which were exposed by an investigation by the national sex discrimination commissioner.

The investigation was triggered by a staffer’s allegation that she was raped while drunk by a colleague in a minister’s office in 2019.
The staffer accused the then conservative government of treating her rape allegation as a political problem and of dissuading her from complaining to police.
Thorpe told the Senate on Thursday that Van harassed her around the time that the staffer’s complaints captured national media attention two years ago.
The previous government had agreed with Thorpe’s request to shift Van to a different office to reduce their interaction walking to and from the Senate.
The Associated Press does not normally identify alleged victims of sexual assault but Thorpe made the accusations publicly.
Thorpe said Van groped her in a stairwell where there were no security cameras.
“There are different understandings of what amounts to sexual assault. What I experienced was being followed, aggressively propositioned and inappropriately touched,” Thorpe tearfully told the Senate.

She said she would not complain to police or sue in a civil court but had complained to the independent Parliamentary Workplace Support Service, which handles workplace complaints.
Van welcomed the service’s investigation of what he described as “outrageous claims.”
“Sen. Thorpe’s allegations are concocted from beginning to end. Nothing that she has alleged about me is truthful,” Van told the Senate.
There is a pattern of Australian male lawmakers using sexist and abusive behavior to undermine their female opponents.
Dutton suggested Thorpe’s allegations were not the only reason Van was expelled from the party.
“Since the airing of Sen. Thorpe’s allegation yesterday, further allegations in relation to Sen. Van have been brought to my attention overnight this morning,” Dutton told reporters.
“I’m not making any judgment on the veracity of allegations or any individual’s guilt or innocence. I make that very clear. Obviously, there’s an independent process with the Parliamentary Workplace Support service to get under way,” Dutton said."

Skates are High! Zeel's Funky New TVC Showcases its Next-gen Rainwear,2023-06-15T09:45:00.000000000+00:00,"NewsVoir
Mumbai (Maharashtra) [India], June 15: At the crack of the monsoons hitting several parts of India, Zeel Rainwear, the country's number one rainwear brand has launched its new TVC campaign. The new campaign showcases the new generation of rainwear, designed with the ever moving citizen in mind.
Over the years, Zeel Rainwear has soared its way to the top of the category, and it has done so by developing products focused on the core needs of consumers, i.e. staying dry even in extreme rain conditions. Zeel's erstwhile campaign 'Sada Sukhe Raho' anchored on this benefit.
Commenting on the campaign, Rohit Trivedi - Director, Zeel Rainwer, said, ""We at Zeel believe in making products which add value to our consumers' lives. We Indians often commute in extreme rains to go about our everyday routines, many by riding two-wheelers or wading through traffic on foot. Regular rainwear brands tend to obstruct mobility, and we have constantly innovated to design our new generation of rainwear that enhances mobility. This season, we have pushed the bar by bringing innovative features such as withstanding 10,000 mm of water pressure, water repellent coating for quick drying and specially crafted air vents to keep our everyday warriors cool and dry on the move.""
Conceptualized by Alpha1, a young boutique agency based out of Mumbai, the TVC is a 30-second film featuring a skating enthusiast effortlessly cruising through the rain, donning Zeel rainwear. Gliding his way through everyday obstacles like potholes and puddles, heavy traffic & rain, the skater demonstrates gravity defying moves, flaunting the rainwear's design focus on mobility.
Commenting on the campaign, Dorothy Rebello - Co-founder, Alpha1, says ""Our task was to deliver two things - introduce the new range of rainwear which is designed for mobility & say this in 10 seconds - as the 10-second edit would run the most to achieve media efficiency! After looking at the products, it was instinctive that we had to showcase the product by virtue of a demo. A skater on in the Mumbai rains wearing rainwear is a amusing visual, with an ability to stand out in media clutter. I'm glad we've been able to deliver this crisp message in 10 seconds while keeping the TVC charm in the 30 second version.""
Link to the campaign : youtu.be/mUMQeUqNNHE.
Zeel Rainwear is part of NZ Seasonal Wear Private Limited established in 1995, pioneers in developing climate wear for every season be it rains, winter or summers. Over the years Zeel Rainwear has successfully become India's #1 rainwear brand with consumers all over the country and delivery customized rainwear & safety solutions for corporates.

"Tesla's market value soars almost $300 billion in just a month as deals with GM, Ford supercharge the EV maker's stock",2023-06-15T09:45:00.000000000+00:00,"Tesla added nearly $300 billion in market value in just a month. (Photo credit should read FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP via Getty Images)
 Redeem now
The market value of EV leader Tesla has surged by nearly $300 billion in just the past month.
The colossal gains follow fresh deals with GM and Ford that allow them access to Tesla's supercharger network.
Elon Musk's carmaker had a market capitalization of $813.9 billion as of Wednesday.
Tesla's stock is on a tear again, with Elon Musk's electric-vehicle maker adding an eye-popping $287 billion in market value in just the past month.
The spectacular surge in market capitalization tracks a record 13-day winning streak for the stock to highs unseen in eight months. The shares surged 26% in June alone, rebounding a stunning 68% from late-April lows, to Wednesday's closing level of $256.79.
That's boosted the EV maker's market cap to $813.9 billion, from $527.2 billion as of mid-May, according to Refinitiv data.
The impressive stock rally partly reflects increasing investor optimism about Tesla's ability to monetize its EV charging technologies and infrastructure, adding to income from car sales. Musk's company recently finalized deals with General Motors and Ford to allow them access to its supercharger network.
The move is aimed at ensuring Tesla's competitors will be on ""equal footing,"" the billionaire entrepreneur said in a Twitter discussion.
""Tesla aspires to be as helpful as possible to other car companies. We made all our patents freely available several years ago,"" Musk said in a tweet. ""Now, we are enabling other companies to use our Supercharger network. Also happy to license Autopilot/FSD or other Tesla technology,"" he added.
Wedbush predicts more Tesla stock gains
Wedbush Securities expects the charging-tech deals will help the Tesla stock surge 17% from current levels to $300 a share. ""For Tesla, we believe this is a large monetization opportunity for the company in its supercharger story, adding to its growing sum-of-the-parts valuation,"" analyst Dan Ives wrote in a recent note.
He added that Tesla's price cutting mechanism in the US and China will also help spur demand for Tesla vehicles, further boosting the company's upward trajectory.
The EV maker's stock gains are also in line with accelerated advances in tech shares in recent weeks, as investors stepped up bets that the Federal Reserve would pause its interest-rate increases this month. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index has climbed 12% since mid-May.
The central bank kept borrowing costs on hold at its meeting this week, snapping a series of 10 consecutive increases aimed at taming inflation that hit 40-year highs in 2022.
Musk recently poked fun at the legendary investor Bill Miller for shorting Tesla stock when it was less than half its current value.
In a tweet last weekend, he replied with a laughing emoji in response to a CNBC interview in early January in which Miller said that he was betting against the carmaker because of increased industry competition.

Victoria Coren Mitchell Accuses New York Times In ‘Only Connect’ Row – Report Door,2023-06-15T09:43:02.000000000+00:00,"She’s turned her seemingly esoteric quiz into one of the UK’s most beloved game shows, and now Victoria Coren Mitchell has accused The New York Times of copying the format.
The presenter said a newly-launched Times quiz, titled Connections, bears a striking similarity to Only Connect, the BBC show she has fronted since 2008.
In Connections, players must group words that share a comment thread. Only Connect, meanwhile, tasks contestants with making connections between apparently unconnected things.
Wyna Liu, the Times‘ Associate Puzzles Editor, tweeted about the launch of Connections on Monday. On Friday, Coren Mitchell replied: “Do you know this has been a TV show in the UK since 2008 ?! It’s so similar I guess you must do?”
Mike Turner, a question setter on Only Connect, added: “If you need a hand at all, I’ve written over 750 of these for Only Connect.”
The Times has been contacted for comment. Banijay, the European production giant that owns Only Connect, is understood to be aware of the similarities but declined to comment. The BBC declined to comment.

Soda ash fundamentals are likely to soften further as the new capacity will outpace demand by 2 million tonne in aggregate in FY24, according to Morgan Stanley. Declining Chinese soda ash prices, near-term demand hiccups, and deflationary pressure could drive more price cuts and a progressively lower unit margin to mid-cycle levels by fiscal 2025, it said.
The upside from new U.S. contracts is offset by lower margins in other geographies, according to the research firm. Lower margins in India and Kenya are a function of falling regional prices, while the U.K. margin reflects new contracts kicking in in fiscal 2024.
Morgan Stanley sees potential for higher gas costs for ethane used in olefin production. It estimates that a 10% rise would have a 7% impact on earnings. Specialty chemical acquisitions are likely to struggle amid weak animal feed demand.

Here's what the brokerage said about Tata Chemicals:
Rated 'equal weight' with a target price of Rs 916, this implies an upside potential of 6%.
Expects less-tight soda ash markets and sees greater supply visibility over FY24.

The likelihood is that earnings growth will slow amid lower prices, demand softness, and margin pressures as the global cost curve deflates.
Key Risks:
Ramp-up of the inner Mongolia capacity amid sluggish Chinese demand is a key headwind for Tata Chemicals' Indian margin.
Chinese soda ash prices are down 30% since March, which will push Tata Chemicals to adjust prices lower to reflect increased regional competition.
Operations in the U.K. and Kenya, which reported their best years in FY23, will also show a normalising unit margin."
"Philadelphia woman's Uber ride takes dramatic turn after driver is shot in the head, crashes into pole: police",2023-06-15T09:42:00.000000000+00:00,"A Philadelphia woman’s Uber ride Wednesday evening took a dramatic turn as her driver was shot in the head, causing the vehicle to jump a curb and crash into a utility pole, police said.
The Philadelphia Police Department said the unidentified female passenger, 18, told detectives she heard gunshots and crouched down in the seat to avoid injury when her driver, 34, was struck in the head and subsequently crashed.
""He was driving the 18-year-old passenger when a bullet went into the Honda CR-V, through both headrests and struck him in the head,"" Philadelphia Police Chief Inspector Scott Small said. ""That’s when the driver lost control, jumped the curb and the utility pole. That’s where it [the vehicle] came to rest.""
""She’s extremely lucky because that bullet missed her by a matter of inches since she was in the back seat when the bullet came through the back window,"" Small added at the scene.

Windows 11’s latest update proves disastrous for some Chrome users,2023-06-15T09:40:17.000000000+00:00,"The latest update for Windows 11 has totally broken Google’s Chrome browser for users of a popular antivirus app.
For Malwarebytes users, patch KB5027231 for Windows 11 22H2 causes Chrome to fail to work – the browser window simply doesn’t appear, even though there is a running Chrome instance in Task Manager.
Neowin spotted that Malwarebytes staff members have posted several times on the issue, to let affected folks know that the company is investigating and working on an update to fix the issue. Users also note that there’s no issue with Windows 10 and Chrome.
A Malwarebytes employee going by the forum name Msherwood posted to say: “We’re currently experiencing issues with Malwarebytes Exploit Protection and Chrome in Windows 11 where you’ll see Chrome crash. We suspect this is happening due to a Windows Update (KB5027231) that was released on June 13, 2023.
“We’re actively troubleshooting this and we’ll be back with more info as soon as possible.”
A further update to that post notes that there is a fix now in the beta of Malwarebytes 4.
Analysis: There is a fudged workaround, too
The good news is that if you don’t want to switch to the beta of Malwarebytes – and let’s face it, most folks won’t (beta software may well have problems of its own) – there is a workaround which has been successfully applied according to numerous reports.
Some people have simply turned off Malwarebytes Exploit Protection, but that leaves you vulnerable as you might imagine, and there’s a more targeted fudge as provided by another staff member at the company, Arthi.
That is to turn off Chrome as a protected app in Malwarebytes. To do this, go to Settings, and the Security tab, and under Exploit Protection, click the ‘Manage Protected Applications’ button. Then find Google Chrome in the list of apps and turn off the protection slider.
Obviously that still isn’t ideal, as Malwarebytes will no longer be protecting Chrome against exploits. If that makes you uncomfortable, the only other path is to uninstall the Windows update (KB5027231) and live without it until the security company provides a full fix. That should be soon enough, given that the cure is already in beta as mentioned.
There is one other workaround suggested by Arthi, and this is to set Chrome as your default browser in Windows 11 (if it isn’t already, obviously). However, a couple of reports in the customer support thread suggest that this didn’t make any difference.
It’s worth a shot, though, seeing as this is a workaround which won’t hinder your level of security with Chrome (turning off exploit protection certainly does).
Interestingly, there’s a claim that Malwarebytes isn’t the only antivirus vendor affected, and an ESET user reckons they have encountered it – and that the problem is caused by having any other Chromium browser set as your default (such as Microsoft Edge). Take that with lots and lots of salt, though it makes some sense in that one of the suggestions from Malwarebytes is to change Chrome to be your default browser.
We’ll keep an eye on the situation as it develops to ascertain whether or not other antivirus apps are also hit by this gremlin.

Airtel becomes first telco to launch 5G on Kochi's water metro route,2023-06-15T09:39:00.000000000+00:00,"New Delhi: Bharti Airtel has expanded its 5G coverage in Kochi by launching the next-gen service in the picturesque island city’s water metro route.
Airtel’s 5G connectivity will be available to customers taking the Kerala Water Metro service between the High Court-Vypin terminals and the Vyttila-Kakkanad terminals in Kochi.
”It’s yet another milestone in our ambition to deliver blazing fast 5G speeds to as many of our customers as possible, including on waterways…our customers can now enjoy the power of the 5G service on the water metro ride and relish the scenic beauty of Kochi,” Amit Gupta, Airtel’s COO (Kerala) said in a statement Thursday.

H&M sales flatline as cool weather hits demand for summer clothing,2023-06-15T09:38:00.000000000+00:00,"Fashion chain H&M has revealed weaker-than-expected sales over the latest quarter after demand was weighed down by chilly weather.
The Swedish retail giant, however, added that June trading has started well amid improving conditions, driving an increase in shares in early trading.
It told investors on Thursday morning that net sales were “flattish compared with last year” over the three months to May 31, with revenues to 57.61 billion Swedish kronor (€4.97 billion).
Analysts had predicted the company would report a 1 per cent sales increase for the period, after H&M had already flagged in late March that demand for spring and summer styles was being impacted by cooler weather.
In a statement, the firm said: “Sales in the second quarter were affected by unfavourable weather conditions compared to the corresponding period last year on several of the H&M group’s large markets.

“June has got off to a good start.”
Analysts from Jefferies said: “This is a clear lag to global peers, partly explained by a more mature US footprint and the impact of cold weather in May in parts of Northern Europe.”
It comes a week after Spanish rival Inditex, which owns Zara, revealed a 13 per cent surge in sales – up 15 per cent with currency movements stripped out – over the year to April as it shrugged off pressures on consumer finances.
Inditex had said sales growth remained in double digits, up 16 per cent on a constant currency basis, since May 1 as it said “spring/summer collections continue to be very well received by our customers”."
Poco emerges as India’s fastest growing online smartphone brand,2023-06-15T09:34:00.000000000+00:00,"Poco's success in the Indian market has been growing since its inception and now the brand has reached a new milestone. Poco has emerged as India's fastest-growing online smartphone.
According to a report by Canalys, Poco registered 68% year-on-year (YoY) growth in sales during the first quarter of the year. To recall, India's overall smartphone market saw a 10% to 15 percent decline during the same period. The online smartphone market didn't fare too well, with online sales on the decline (20 percent down).
A Bright Future
According to Poco India's Country Head, Himanshu Tandon, the brand aims to achieve anywhere between 75% to 80% year-on-year growth this year. Tandon noted that at least 60 percent of Poco customers are repeat buyers.
Poco is also reportedly expanding its reach to offline channels by setting up four distributors in major cities like Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Delhi, and Mumbai. The move is targeted towards strengthening the brand's presence and making it more accessible to offline buyers.
Key to Poco's Success
Tandon added that the driving force for Poco were the launch of three new C-series smartphones as well as the Poco X5 Pro, which helped the company boost sales in the Rs 20,000 to Rs 25,000 price range.
Poco's growth in the Indian market can be down to its value-oriented formula, delivering reasonably priced smartphones with segment-leading specifications. The recently launched Poco F5 was one of those phones, delivering the best performance of any smartphone in the sub-30K segment."

Speaking to The Sun after landing the role of Caleb, Will also revealed how his soap connections off-screen meant he wasn't nervous about the role.
He told us: “I’ve met a lot of the actors who play those roles before.
“I knew Lisa Riley from Oldham Theatre Workshop, so it was less daunting having known those people than if I didn’t know anybody.
“Lucy Pargeter, too, I worked with her a long time ago as well. So the people I was working with I had a bit of a relationship with so I wasn’t as scared as probably I should have been.”

American tourists aged 41 and 22 are found dead inside their luxury Hyatt Mexican hotel room amid fears they were poisoned by a gas,2023-06-15T09:31:00.000000000+00:00,"Two American tourists have been found dead in their luxury hotel room in Baja California Sur, Mexico.
Police and paramedics arrived at the Hotel Rancho Pescadero, where rooms cost up to $760 a night, at around 9pm on Tuesday after receiving reports that a man and women were unconscious.
The pair were pronounced dead at the scene, said police, who stated the suspected cause of death was gas inhalation.
The victims have been identified as John Heathco, 41, and Abby Lutz, 22, according to the Baja California Sur Attorney General's office.
Lutz is from Newport Beach, California, the AG's office said. Local police initially said both victims were in their mid-30s.

Their cause of death was 'intoxication by substance to be determined', the Attorney General's office said in a statement to ABC on Wednesday.
The man and woman had been dead for about 10 or 11 hours when they were found at the luxury hotel in the seaside community of El Pescadero, according to the AG's office.
The office said there were no signs of violence on their bodies, and added the local attorney general is currently overseeing the investigation.
The Hotel Rancho Pescadero, a luxury Hyatt hotel, is in the seaside community of El Pescadero, which is located between Todos Santos and the resort of Los Cabos.

Hyatt has been approached for comment.
The tragedy comes after several cases of such deaths in Mexico due to poisoning by carbon monoxide or other gases. Such gases are often produced by improperly vented or leaky water heaters and stoves.
In October, three US citizens were found dead at a rented apartment in Mexico, apparently victims of gas inhalation.
The Mexico City police department said the three were found unresponsive on October 30 in an upscale neighborhood. They had apparently rented the dwelling for a short visit. Post-mortem examinations suggested the two men and one woman died of carbon monoxide poisoning.
In Mexico, proper gas line installations, vents and monitoring devices are often lacking.
In 2018, a gas leak in a water heater caused the deaths of an American couple and their two children in the resort town of Tulum, south of Playa del Carmen.
An inspection revealed that the water heater at the rented condominium was leaking gas. Prosecutors said the gas leak was perhaps caused by a lack of maintenance or the age of the equipment.
In 2010, the explosion of an improperly installed gas line at a hotel in Playa del Carmen killed five Canadian tourists and two Mexicans.
In that case, prosecutors said the gas line, apparently meant to fuel a pool heating unit, was not properly installed or maintained. They said gas leaking from the line may have been ignited in an explosion by a spark from an electric switch or plug."

Steam gets a major UI overhaul,2023-06-15T09:29:11.000000000+00:00,"Valve has released a major UI overhaul for the Steam client, giving the PC gaming shopfront a slick new look.
We knew a major UI overhaul was coming as far back as late April, when the Steam Client Beta showcased many of the changes. However, now those changes have come to the Steam Client proper, meaning that every Steam user can get a taste of something new.
In a blog post on the release, Valve runs through some of the major changes. The new Steam client is build on a new framework that will make it easier for the company to apply changes across all of the distinct Steam iterations, including the Steam Desktop Client, Big Picture Mode, Steam Deck, and Steam on mobile.
You won’t see any of that, of course, but you will instantly notice a fresh look for the Steam client. Dialogues, menus, fonts, and colours have all been spruced up.
Valve has also made notifications more useful in Steam, with the green bell icon only lighting up when there’s actually something new for you. The tray view will only show new notifications, meanwhile.
Steam’s in-game overlay has also received some serious attention. Shift-Tabbing during a game gives you a new look with a new toolbar, and you can personalise what’s shown. You can also now pin windows from the overlay so that they appear on top of the game while you’re playing, with adjustable opacity.
This should prove particularly useful for the new Notes feature, which provides a lightweight note-taking overlay over your current game. Your notes are saved to each game and synced across devices.
A new Game Overview panel will give you a one stop look at everything happening with a particular game, including achievements, friends playing, guides, and news.
Mac and Linux users haven’t been forgotten in this Steam UI overhaul either, with hardware acceleration now bringing performance up to par with the Windows version.

EU regulators checking if Vivendi jumped gun in Lagardere acquisition,2023-06-15T09:28:00.000000000+00:00,"By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS (Reuters) -EU antitrust regulators are checking whether French media conglomerate Vivendi closed its acquisition of French publisher Lagardere deal before securing regulatory approval, the European Commission said on Thursday.
Such so-called gun jumping can result in fines of up to 10% of a company's group aggregate turnover. The EU antitrust watchdog has in recent years cranked up fines for such offences as a deterrent.
The EU executive said it was alerted by media reports but has not opened a formal investigation yet.
""The Commission was made aware of allegations of gun jumping, which have been reported in the press. The Commission can confirm that it is looking into the matter,"" the EU executive said in an email.
Vivendi declined to comment.
The EU competition enforcer last week cleared the deal with conditions. Infringement proceedings are handled separately from the merger review.

Four once-off social welfare payments to be paid or apply for in June,2023-06-15T09:25:00.000000000+00:00,"When it comes to payments for social welfare recipients, June is a pretty big month as several are either due or have already opened.
You could also be in line for a few benefits, dependent on circumstances.
Here are four payments due in June or already open to know about and if you qualify for them:

Working Family Payment
According to the Department of Social Protection, around 46,000 people who qualify for the Working Family Payment have already been paid the April cost-of-living payment, RSVP reports.
However, there are many who will be paid retrospectively, with this group due to receive their money before the end of the week starting June 12.
They shared: ""The Working Family Payment (WFP) is a weekly in-work support which provides an income top-up for employees on low earnings with children.
""To qualify for the WFP, the customer must be working a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight in ongoing insurable employment and have at least one qualified child who normally resides with them.
""The cost of living payment is payable to customers who have an entitlement to the WFP between April 17 and 23. Approximately 46,000 WFP customers have received the cost of living payment to date.
""If a WFP customer was not in payment between April 17 and 23, but has since been awarded the WFP retrospectively, there will be an entitlement to receive the cost of living payment provided it has not already been paid on another qualifying scheme.
""These cases are currently being validated and are due to be paid in the next two weeks.""
Back-to-School Clothing and Footwear Allowance
The applications for Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance opened up this month.
This payment aims to provide support for families so they can help with the cost of uniforms and footwear for children going to school. It is expected that it will be paid the week starting 10 July 2023.
Children aged 4-11 get €260 and children aged 12 and over receive €385. People will also receive an added €100, which was confirmed earlier in the year as a spring cost-of-living boost.
The Department of Social Protection will let you know if you are paid automatically using your MyWelfare account, or by post, before the end of June 2023. You can find out how to apply here.
Carer's Support Grant
Each year, the Carer's Support Grant is automatically paid to people getting Carer's Allowance in June.
Depending on their circumstances, people can receive payment anywhere from €236 to €411.
Child Benefit
Earlier this month, parents and legal guardians should have received their regular Child Benefit payment - along with an additional once-off €100.
The payment date was 6 June, however, due to the Bank Holiday, many may have received it earlier.
However, it should be noted that this is a once-off payment to help with the cost of living and is not a permanent increase.

Kellogg’s Cereal: Good. Night. Snack.- 06.23.14,2023-06-15T09:23:17.000000000+00:00,"I don’t know why this is so amusing today. Apparently Kellogg’s has created “Limited Edition Packaging” for some of their cereals - having them go dark. They actually have the night sky filled with stars instead of their brighter usual boxes… I thought my mom was joking - so she scanned over a coupon as proof. My first thought was - are there glow in the dark marshmallow stars inside? Second thought - are there really people out there who didn’t know they can eat cereal at ANY hour? Third thought - what’s going on with the cereal industry to need to change ONLY the packaging to tell people they can eat cereal at night?!?!?!
But maybe it worked - when we noticed the box of twilight Mini Wheats - we bought it. And i had to take pics of how absurd the packaging is to share with you. And now i’m totally having some at night… See it all on the next page!

Fujfilm’s Instax SQ40 marries retro charm with larger square film,2023-06-15T09:18:04.000000000+00:00,"Fujifilm’s line of instant cameras has grown again with the launch of the Instax SQ40. The new model borrows retro cues from the Mini 40, while shooting larger-format square film like previous SQ models.
Unlike the shiny plastic square format models of the past, the SQ40 is wrapped in faux black leather with silver accents. It measures 5.25 inches wide by 4.5 inches tall by 2.25 inches thick, so it’s considerably larger than the Mini 40 and other rectangular cameras. For easy carrying, it comes with a shoulder strap with quick release loops.
Fujifilm/Cactus Images Limited
The lens is retractable and has three modes, starting with the fully retracted “off” position that makes the camera relatively flat and closes the protective cap. In the “on” position, it extends and the lens cap opens, giving a field of view equivalent to 65.75 mm (35mm equivalent, presumably) for shooting no closer than 19.7 inches. And finally, there’s a “macro” mode for selfies that lets you shoot between 11.8 and 19.7 inches, with a small mirror at the front so you can see yourself and friends.
It has automatic exposure and shoots on the Instax Square frame to a 2.4- by 2.4-inch image area on a 3.4- by 2.8-inch film size. Unlike some Instax models, there doesn’t appear to be any saving to a digital format, so this is about as analog as modern cameras get.
Fujifilm
The SQ40 costs $150 and is expected to be available for purchase by the end of June 2023. The basic white-border version of the square film costs around $19 for 20 exposures, and a new version called Instax Square “Sunset” with pastel shaded borders (above) is $15.75 for a 10-pack. Finally, Fujifilm released a new brown colorway for the Mini Evo priced at $200, also available at the end of June.

US injunction temporarily blocks Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard acquisition leading up court battle,2023-06-15T09:17:51.000000000+00:00,"The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has placed a temporary block on Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard.
The injunction prevents Microsoft from making any kind of bid to acquire Activision Blizzard until the matter is settled in court. Given the FTC’s concerns that the acquisition breaches anti-trust laws, the imminent court case will be a pivotal moment for Microsoft (via CNBC)
Microsoft’s acquisition plans have received global scrutiny, being approved in China, blocked in the UK, and only approved in the EU with significant caveats.
The acquisition, valued at $68.7 billion, will have significant ramifications for the gaming industry if it goes ahead. As such, the case is to be bought before an internal administrative law judge in the US. The case is set to be heard in August.
Should Microsoft fail to convince the court that its acquisition isn’t in breach of US anti-monopoly laws, the tech giant would still have some recourse and would be able to appeal the decision in federal court, in a similar fashion to its ongoing appeal against the UK government’s decision to prevent the acquisition.
Both the EU and the UK’s regulatory bodies identified significant concerns when it came to Microsoft’s share of the cloud gaming market, currently estimated at somewhere around 65% according to the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority.
Though Xbox Game Pass undoubtedly offers great value for money, it would be concerning if Microsoft was able to establish a monopoly in the cloud gaming space. Though Google Stadia and On Live both went the way of the dodo, streaming technology has become sufficiently reliable in recent years as to allow cloud gaming to have a mass market appeal that it’s never previously enjoyed.
The list of best Xbox Game Pass games is intimidatingly long for the likes of Amazon Luna and PlayStation Plus, the latter of which offers its Classics Catalogue to subscribers via the cloud. Hopefully, FTC scrutiny will ensure that, if the acquisition does take place, it’ll occur in a manner that keeps the cloud gaming market open and competitive, rather than allowing it to become Microsoft’s personal fiefdom.

NFL looks to give a boost to Black- and minority-owned banks,2023-06-15T09:16:52.000000000+00:00,"A football with the NFL logo.

The National Football League is making a big play to increase lending in underrepresented communities.
The league is borrowing $78 million from a syndicate of Black- and minority-owned banks and community development financial institutions.
The loan deal will generate “tier 1 capital” for the banks and CDFIs. According to the National Black Bank Foundation, it will boost their lending power by millions through banking fees and interest. The full terms of the loan are not being released.
However, Joe Siclare, the NFL’s executive vice president of finance and league policy, said the terms are at “market rates,” and the league plans to fully draw on the loan over the next three years.
“These banks play a vital role in our overall economy and many of them are in markets that our teams play, so there is good synergy there,” Siclare told CNBC.
“These community banks sometimes have difficulty navigating down economic times. When large corporations like the National Football League can partner and provide reliable revenue streams, it helps those banks continue to do the great work they do in their communities,” he added.
The NFL deal follows a similar $35 million loan linked to the National Basketball Association’s Atlanta Hawks for a practice facility in 2020 and a $25 million loan with Major League Soccer in 2022, both of which were arranged by the NBBF and a syndicate of Black-owned banks.
NBBF co-founder Ashley Bell is hopeful these deals will prove Black- and minority-owned banks are viable partners for large corporations long term, especially with the threat of an economic downturn or recession that would likely have a bigger effect on communities of color.
“These banks loan money to people and businesses that need it without being predatory. This gives them breathing room. These banks are centers of hope around the country. Whether they are Martin Luther King, Jr Drive or Main Street,” Bell said. These are the places people go to get opportunity and by supporting these institutions, the NFL is supporting these communities.”
The NFL consulted with Bank of America and the NBBF on its loan.
“It’s definitely a needed shot in the arm at a time when community banking is being questioned,” Bell said.
Bell said the regional banking crisis triggered by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March has the potential to destabilize many Black and minority financial institutions. The NBBF says in many cases, Black and minority banks are “hyper local,” providing 85% or more of the loans to underrepresented groups in their area.
“Doing a deal with an entity like the NFL, that helps your brand. It helps people understand that you can do a complex deal. So, if you can do a deal with the NFL, surely you can trust that bank with your home loan,” Bell said. “Surely you can trust that bank with a line of credit for your business, your church, your faith organization. You can go to them and trust that you’ll get the best service.”
The NFL’s involvement will create opportunity for Black- and minority-owned banks to make income and then put that money out into the community, according to Dominik Mjartan, CEO of Optus Bank in Columbia, South Carolina, one of 16 financial institutions partnering on the loan.
“The NFL giving us this chance to participate, it enhances our ability to deliver on our mission to serve underserved, underestimated high-potential customers and communities,” he said."

“The advanced functionality significantly increases the range of the current system, enhances cruise missile defense capability and establishes G/ATOR as the most agile ground-based surveillance and integrated fire control system available today,” said Melissa Johanson, director, advanced land sensors, Northrop Grumman. “We are committed to outpacing modern adversary threat systems for partner and allied forces with advanced surveillance and fire control capability.”
G/ATOR combines five of the Marine Corps’ single-mission radars into one multi-mission system for total air and missile defense surveillance. This provides a new level of protection and situational understanding for warfighters and enables them to make better decisions when it matters most. The Marine Corps has been granted funding from Congress for eight additional G/ATOR systems. To date, 21 of the awarded 46 Northrop Grumman systems have been fielded.
G/ATOR is one piece of the solution providing joint forces with an operational picture and deep breadth of data to operate in today’s contested environment, in support of the U.S. Marine Corps’ Force Design 2030 strategy.

Moody’s affirms QIIB’s rating with a stable outlook,2023-06-15T09:15:00.000000000+00:00,"Doha, Qatar: Moody’s Investors Service has affirmed “QIIB” long-term ratings at (A2/Prime-1) with a stable outlook. This indicates the bank’s strong indicators and its reliance on valuable self-objective factors.
Moody’s affirmation of QIIB’s long-term ratings highlights the bank’s strong profitability, with a 2.1 percent return on assets for the first three months of 2023, supported by its Islamic banking excellence and exceptional cost efficiency (cost-to-income ratio of 19.1 percent for the first three months of 2023).
Moody’s also noted the bank’s reduced reliance on market funding, which decreased to 17 percent (as of March 2023) from 29 percent (as of December 2019), combined with the bank’s strong liquidity and solid asset quality. The agency explained that the stable outlook for the bank’s long-term ratings reflects Moody’s expectation that the bank will maintain its strong profitability, capital, and liquidity in the face of risks.
Moody’s further indicated that QIIB ‘s high rating is supported by the ongoing expectation of a highly probable government support when needed, relying on the government’s contribution to the bank and the strong track record of preventive support for all local banks by the Qatari government in the past.
QIIB chief executive officer Dr. Abdulbasit Ahmed al Shaibei (pictured) commented on Moody’s affirmation of the bank’s rating at (A2) with a stable outlook, stating, “We are pleased with this rating and high evaluation from Moody’s, as it confirms our financial strength and alignment with Qatar’s renowned regional and international economic position. We are indeed indebted to our elevated ratings, which reflect the exceptional standing and strength of the Qatari economy.”
He noted, “Moody’s rating of QIIB gains additional significance this time, considering the unusual circumstances experienced by global markets and the uncertainties faced by
many financial institutions worldwide, resulting from the global economic conditions and the high inflation in several countries, as well as the geopolitical challenges that disrupted supply chains, which have not fully recovered from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and led to an increase in the cost of goods, negatively impacting the markets.”
“Moody’s affirmation on QIIB’s rating clearly shows that we have largely succeeded in facing emerging challenges and market volatility, achieving positive results across various indicators based on the implementation of our strategic and phased plans approved by the Board of Directors. These plans have always focused on the domestic market and risk management through a careful policy that shielded us
from any undesirable consequences.”
He noted, “QIIB has also continued to improve its performance and enhance operational efficiency through decisive steps in digital transformation. These have resulted in tangible results seen in the bank’s indicators, earning the satisfaction of customers from various segments, leading to an expansion of our customer base.”
QIIB chief executive officer expressed confidence that the exceptional trends identified in Moody’s report on the bank will continue to elevate the bank’s financial position and various budget items in the coming period. “This confidence is based on the exceptional efforts exerted and the utilisation of strong factors and opportunities provided by the local business sector, as well as the optimistic expectations regarding the direction of Qatar’s economic growth in the upcoming phase.”"

Before the official launch, Hyundai has now revealed the cabin of the upcoming entry-level SUV that will take position below the Venue in the line-up. Hyundai has already started accepting bookings for the new car and has now officially revealed the cabin of the upcoming Exter.
The upcoming Exter is based on the Grand i10 NIOS platform and the cabin also gets a similar layout. The car gets an all-black layout with traces of olive green all over. The front seats get ‘Exter’ monikers as well.

Hyundai will offer a digital driver display, unlike the Grand i10 NIOS with the Exter. The base variants might offer the analogue dials though. The car will come loaded with features just like all other Hyundai products. We will get to see goodies like an 8.0-inch infotainment screen, connected car tech like Apple CarPlay and Android Auto and wireless phone charger as well. The climate control system is automatic, the Exter will also offer features like automatic headlamps, cruise control and a sunroof.

Adding to the muscular appeal, the rear view of the Hyundai Exter includes a robust-looking faux silver skid plate positioned within the black body cladding on the lower portion of the rear bumper. Completing the design, reflectors are positioned on the upper corners of the faux silver skid plate.

It will come with a standard 5-speed manual gearbox, and there may also be an option for a 5-speed AMT. For the higher variants, there could be an additional choice of a 1.0-litre turbocharged petrol engine, which is already available in the Venue model.
In terms of competition, the Exter will be pitted against other sub-compact SUVs like the Tata Punch and Citroen C3. It will also face competition from lower-spec, naturally-aspirated variants of compact SUVs such as the Nissan Magnite, and Renault Kiger."
Service update issued by Royal Mail following this week’s disruption.,2023-06-15T09:05:22.000000000+00:00,"Royal Mail’s service update on Thursday, June 15, 2023, comes after a minor disruption on Wednesday which caused some delays. The issue was caused by problems with the air, rail, road, and mail centres networks, affecting select postcodes for a 24-hour period. However, the postal service has confirmed that there is no significant issue with the logistics operation for today, and deliveries and collection services will remain on track as expected across the UK.
According to a statement on the Royal Mail website, “Deliveries are operating as normal across the UK today. We aim to deliver to all addresses we have mail for, six days a week.” While most areas reported no major issues today, the Auchterarder SUDO (PH3 and PH4) postcode in Scotland has been identified as most impacted by local issues. This may cause some delays due to a range of local factors, including staff absence and resourcing problems.
Royal Mail issued a statement addressing the issue, stating, “In a small number of local offices, this may temporarily not be possible due to local issues such as high levels of sickness absence, resourcing or other local factors. In those cases, we will rotate deliveries to minimize the delay to individual customers. We also provide targeted support to those offices to address their challenges and restore our service to the high standard our customers would normally receive.” The postal service apologized for the inconvenience and thanked its customers for understanding.
Customers who are expecting to collect an item using their “Something for You” card are advised to visit the Royal Mail website to find details of customer service point locations and opening hours. Royal Mail is committed to resolving any service disruptions as quickly as possible and ensuring its logistics operation continues to serve all customers six days a week.

DEI - BofA Surpasses $500 Million in Equity Investments to Support Minority and Women Entrepreneurs,2023-06-15T09:05:00.000000000+00:00,"PR Newswire
Investments in Diverse-led Funds Result in Capital Deployed to Over 1,000 Companies Across the U.S.
NEW YORK , June 15, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Bank of America today announced that it has committed more than $500 million in equity investments to minority- and women-led funds, more than doubling its initial $200 million commitment.
The bank has committed equity to more than 150 funds, which to date have invested in over 1,000 companies that span 40 states. These companies are led by 1,500 diverse entrepreneurs and employ over 21,000 people.
""We work across our company to address critical needs in our communities, including the lack of access to capital that diverse business owners face as they start or grow their businesses,"" said Tram Nguyen, Global Head of Strategic and Sustainable Investments at Bank of America. ""We want to empower the talented fund managers who keenly understand how to identify and support those business owners. Each time we support a minority- or women-led fund, they in turn support diverse entrepreneurs, which ultimately helps us toward achieving our goal to advance racial equality and economic opportunity.""
Not only are fund managers breaking down barriers themselves, but they are also investing in companies looking to catalyze change. As a graduate of a Historically Black College and University (HBCU), Nasir Qadree founded Zeal to provide overlooked founders with the resources they need to scale towards their next stage of growth. This includes being an early investor in Esusu, now one of the few Black-owned unicorns, which provides tools to help immigrants and minorities to provide rent reporting and data solutions for credit building.
Chingona Ventures, led by General Partner Samara Hernandez, was the only active fund in the Midwest started and led by a Latina at the time of Bank of America's investment. The fund targets founders with unique backgrounds creating businesses in markets that are often overlooked, like Papaya, a bilingual STEM tutoring organization to close the educational gap for underserved students.
Bank of America continues to innovate and expand the capital and resources entrepreneurs and small business owners of all backgrounds need to help fuel economic growth in their communities. More on Bank of America's work in supporting diverse funds and entrepreneurs can be found here .

The Democrat Saying What Others Won’t,2023-06-15T09:00:05.000000000+00:00,"Back in 2020, Joe Biden stood out in a crowded Democratic primary field filled with younger, more historic candidates. Voters worried that Mr. Biden was too moderate, too uninspiring and too old.
One of his challengers, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, got a lot of attention for his willingness to echo those concerns.
But after going hard at Mr. Biden in a debate, his campaign fizzled and Mr. Castro, once a rising star in the Democratic Party, left Washington altogether. To some, it seemed like evidence of the consequences of stepping out of line with the party.
Heading into the 2024 election, as voters grapple with the same questions about the incumbent president, Astead sits down with Mr. Castro to explore the party’s code of silence surrounding Mr. Biden’s primary alternatives and his advanced age.

Stripe CTO on maintaining small teams in big business,2023-06-15T09:00:00.000000000+00:00,"In the latest episode of For Tech’s Sake, we sat down with David Singleton, chief technology officer at Stripe, to examine what disruption really means in the world of tech and how Stripe scales up.
When we think about the big disruptors of tech, we might think of what some of the now tech behemoths once did.
Microsoft put computers into our homes, Apple revolutionised the idea of the smartphone, Facebook – now Meta – could be considered the original face for social media and Amazon completely disrupted the e-commerce industry.
But the thing about disruption is, it keeps happening no matter what the norm is and no matter who is at the top of the pile driving said norm.
With several of those disruptive tech companies becoming million, billion and even trillion-dollar companies and their once revolutionary technologies becoming standard practice, it’s time for the new kids in town to disrupt the way we live and work.
So, what does tech disruption look like in the new world of web? To help understand the current landscape, For Tech’s Sake hosts Jenny Darmody and Elaine Burke sat down with David Singleton, the CTO of multibillion-dollar Irish-founded fintech Stripe.
Singleton has been a fintech whizz ever since he built some invoicing software for his parents when he was a kid. But before he was the technical lead of Stripe, he spent many years in engineering at Google.
Google was once among the born-on-the-internet companies disrupting industry incumbents, but now it’s one the Big Tech behemoths eating up small businesses that threaten their dominance.
Having been at Stripe for five years, Singleton said one of the things he loves about working there is helping companies take off that “wouldn’t otherwise get started”.
“We do that by providing infrastructure. That means that the small companies in the world, the founders can actually get access to the world’s financial system, in the same way that incumbents have large enterprises.”

Description
Bringing small teams to big companies
As part of a fintech that has become a multibillion-dollar giant embedded in the world’s financial infrastructure, you’d be forgiven for assuming Stripe now operates just like any other large company.
But Singleton also spoke about the importance of maintaining certain elements of start-up culture while rapidly scaling up to become tech giants.
“Small teams work much more effectively together than large teams, mostly because of how many lines of communication you have to have between people,” he said.
“It actually grows with the square of the number of people so as you add one person to your team, you don’t just add one incremental unit of it being more difficult to collaborate together, you add many more lines of communication.”
However, as companies who want and need to scale, he said it’s vital to get the units of the small teams right so that each team has one thing to work on that they understand really well that can be built on.
“That creates an organisation that can get a tonne more done than an organisation where everyone has to collaborate with everyone else in order to move forward.”

"Vulnerability In WooCommerce Stripe Payment Gateway Plugin Affects 900,000+ Websites",2023-06-15T09:00:00.000000000+00:00,"Empower your team and better serve your clients with automated workflows, complete visibility and meaningful metrics.
START A FREE TRIAL➝
The WooCommerce Stripe payment gateway plugin was discovered to have a vulnerability that allows an attacker to steal customer personally identifiable information (PII) from stores using the plugin.
Security researchers warn that hackers do not need authentication to pull off the exploit, which received a rating of high, 7.5 on a scale of 1 – 10.
WooCommerce Stripe Payment Gateway Plugin
The Stripe payment gateway plugin, developed by WooCommerce, Automattic, WooThemes and other contributors, is installed in over 900,000 websites.
It offers an easy way for customers at WooCommerce stores to checkout, with a number of different credit cards and without having to open an account.
A Stripe account is automatically created at checkout, providing customers with a frictionless ecommerce shopping experience.
The plugin works through an application programming interface (API ).
An API is like a bridge between two software that allows the WooCommerce store to interact with the Stripe software to process orders from the website to Stripe seamlessly.
What is the Vulnerability in WooCommerce Stripe Plugin?
Security researchers at Patchstack discovered the vulnerability and responsibly disclosed it to the relevant parties.
According to security researchers at Patchstack:
“This plugin suffers from an Unauthenticated Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability.
This vulnerability allows any unauthenticated user to view any WooCommerce order’s PII data including email, user’s name, and full address.”
WooCommerce Stripe Plugin Versions Affected
The vulnerability affects versions prior to and equal to version 7.4.0.
Developers associated with the plugin updated it to version 7.4.1, which is the most secure version.
These were the security updates made, according to the official plugin changelog:
“Fix – Add Order Key Validation.
Fix – Add sanitization and escaping some outputs.”
There are a couple issues that needed a fix.
The first appears to be a lack of validation, which in general is a check to validate if a request is by an authorized entity.
The next one is sanitization, which refers to a process of blocking any input that is not valid. For example, if an input allows only text then it should be set up in a way that prohibits scripts from being uploaded.
What the changelog mentions is escaping outputs, which is a way to block unwanted and malicious inputs.
The non-profit security organization, Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) explains it like this:
“Encoding and escaping are defensive techniques meant to stop injection attacks.”
The official WordPress API handbook explains it this way:
“Escaping output is the process of securing output data by stripping out unwanted data, like malformed HTML or script tags.
This process helps secure your data prior to rendering it for the end user.”
It is highly recommended that users of the plugin immediately update their plugins to version 7.4.1

Cloud Streaming Being Tested by Sony for ‘Supported’ PS5 Games; Unveiling of PlayStation Plus June Games.,2023-06-15T08:59:25.000000000+00:00,"Sony has recently announced that it is testing cloud streaming for supported PS5 games. This feature, currently in its early stages, will allow PS Plus Premium/Deluxe members to directly stream select PS5 games without having to download them. The games available for streaming include those on the Game Catalog and Game Trials. While no game titles have been confirmed yet, Sony promises to provide as many games as possible. This news follows the recent revelation of Sony’s newest handheld device, Project Q, which uses similar technology. The company has also announced a list of 27 free games coming this month to PS Plus Extra and Deluxe subscribers.
Jim Ryan, CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment, explained in a recent interview that the company sees mobility in gaming habits as an increasingly important trend, and cloud technology will allow them to take advantage of this trend. Sony has experimented with cloud technology before through PlayStation Now, which was later bundled with revised PS Plus. Project Q will feature an 8-inch 1080p screen with a button layout and analogue sticks reminiscent of the PS5 DualSense controller. The device will allow players to stream games from their PS5 consoles via Remote Play or Wi-Fi and is set to launch next year.
Additionally, Sony has announced the complete list of titles coming to the PlayStation Plus Extra and Deluxe/Premium catalogues this month. These games will be available to claim starting on June 20. Far Cry 6, the biggest AAA freebie, allows players to assume the role of a rebel fighting against the ruthless dictator Antón Castillo with creative gunplay, crafting, and more. Other major additions include Rogue Legacy 2, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, Killing Floor 2, and Inscryption.

FDA clears updated COVID-19 vaccines for kids under age 5,2023-06-15T08:57:27.000000000+00:00,"This is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated. Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.
U.S. regulators on Thursday cleared doses of the updated COVID-19 vaccines for children younger than age 5.
The Food and Drug Administration’s decision aims to better protect the littlest kids amid an uptick in COVID-19 cases around the country — at a time when children’s hospitals already are packed with tots suffering from other respiratory illnesses including the flu.
“Vaccination is the best way we know to help prevent the serious outcomes of COVID-19, such as hospitalization and death,” Dr. Peter Marks, FDA’s vaccine chief, told The Associated Press.
Omicron-targeted booster shots made by Moderna and rival Pfizer already were open to everyone 5 and older.
The FDA now has authorized use of the tweaked shots starting at age 6 months — but just who is eligible depends on how many vaccinations they’ve already had, and which kind. Only about 5% of youngsters under age 5 have gotten the full primary series since vaccinations for the littlest kids began in June.
The FDA decided that:
–Children under age 6 who’ve already gotten two original doses of Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine can get a single booster of Moderna’s updated formula if it’s been at least two months since their last shot.
–Pfizer’s vaccine requires three initial doses for tots under age 5 — and those who haven’t finished that vaccination series will get the original formula for the first two shots and the omicron-targeted version for their third shot.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is expected to sign off soon, the final step for shots to begin.
Marks said the bivalent vaccine is safe for tots and will help parents “keep the protection for those children as up to date as possible.”
But children under 5 who already got all three Pfizer doses aren’t yet eligible for an updated booster.
For now, “the good news is they are probably reasonably well-protected,” Marks said.
The FDA expects data from Pfizer and its partner BioNTech sometime next month to determine whether those tots will need an omicron-targeted booster “and we will act on that as soon as we can,” he said.
For parents who haven’t yet gotten their children vaccinated, it’s not too late — especially as “we are entering a phase when COVID-19 cases are increasing,” Marks said.
The updated vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer are combination shots, containing half the original vaccine and half tweaked to match the BA.4 and BA.5 omicron strains that until recently were dominant. Now BA.5 descendants are responsible for most COVID-19 cases.
The CDC last month released the first real-world data showing that an updated booster, using either company’s version, does offer added protection to adults. The analysis found the greatest benefit was in people who’d never had a prior booster, just two doses of the original COVID-19 vaccine — but that even those who’d had a summertime dose were more protected than if they’d skipped the newest shot.

"Crypto Analyst’s Revelation: Ethereum, Binance Coin, and Litecoin on the Verge of Trend Reversals Amid Altcoin Correction – New Opportunities Await",2023-06-15T08:50:59.000000000+00:00,"Michaël van de Poppe, a renowned crypto analyst, reveals critical price levels where Ethereum, Binance Coin, and Litecoin might see trend reversals.
Ethereum needs to maintain support at $1,785 to avoid further declines, Binance Coin could possibly reverse at $200, and Litecoin’s turnaround point might lie between $70 to $73.
As the altcoin market undergoes a notable correction, esteemed cryptocurrency analyst Michaël van de Poppe is identifying potential price points where digital asset bulls may intervene, sparking trend reversals for Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), and Litecoin (LTC).
In his recent video update to his 163,000 YouTube subscribers, Van de Poppe warns that Ethereum is vulnerable to further depreciation unless it manages to uphold support at $1,785. He says,
“This entire area of $1,785 is something we need to sustain. Otherwise, we are going to look at a case that I think we are going to retest the area around $1,600 and have the reversal taking place.”
With Ethereum presently trading at $1,751, Van de Poppe’s suggested reversal point indicates a potential downturn of more than 8% for this leading altcoin.
On the other hand, Van de Poppe’s analysis of Binance Coin, the native utility token of the world’s largest crypto exchange, indicates that BNB’s inability to preserve support around $270 signifies a likely drop towards $200, where it might start to bounce back. He points out,
“We need to reclaim the area of [$270] in order to prevent a market breakdown. We did have this market breakdown, and now we’re looking at potentially taking this liquidity beneath the low here for Binance Coin before we are most likely going to reverse. So I’m looking at bids in this range ($200) if we’re going to get that.”
Currently, BNB is priced at $237.
As for Litecoin, the peer-to-peer payments network, Van de Poppe suggests that it could be nearing the end of its correction phase. He notes,
“I think if we are going to have a reversal taking place, this is the range that we’re looking at, perhaps towards $70 to $73. If that is going to be the case, then I think we’re going to have a swift rally back up.”
At present, Litecoin is trading for $78.78.
Van de Poppe’s analysis serves as a key reference point for investors, providing an insightful perspective on potential turnaround levels amidst the current altcoin correction."

After the fourth time, I saw that Cube Entertainment was also having auditions the week afterward, so I went ahead and auditioned for Cube too.""
Interestingly, the idol received two callbacks at the same time, one from Cube Entertainment and the other from SM Entertainment — home to famous K-pop artists such as EXO, Super Junior, aespa, Girls Generation, Red Velvet, and more.
""I got a call back from both companies,"" she revealed, earning a surprise reaction from the ""Radio Star"" hosts. ""It was a huge struggle, choosing which company to go to. SM was always my dream, after all.""
Yuqi revealed that though her visuals fit the ""cute and pretty"" concept of SM, her voice suited the ""girl crush"" concept of Cube because it was ""husky."" Convincing her more, the Cube director also promised to debut her a year after she signed, which prompted the singer's final decision.
The singer-dancer debuted alongside (G)I-DLE members Minnie, Miyeon, Shuhua, Soyeon and Soojin in 2018. They released their first mini album, ""I Am,"" which featured the main track ""Latata.""
Miyeon used to be a YG Entertainment trainee and was rumored to supposedly debut with Blackpink. Soojin was formerly signed to DN Entertainment, while Soyeon, Shuhua, and Minnie were already trainees at Cube, per Koreaboo.
(G) I-DLE had a successful debut, skyrocketing to fame for pulling off the fierce and girl crush concept, having a captivating stage presence, undeniable visuals and vocal talent.
The members have also been praised for being involved in producing their own music, including their hit tracks ""HWAA,"" ""Lost,"" ""Tomboy,"" ""Nxde"" and ""Queencard,"" among others.
In 2021, Soojin got involved in a huge controversy where she was accused of school violence, prompting (G)I-DLE to take an indefinite hiatus. Amid the break, Soojin departed from the group. (G)I-DLE has since been promoting its music as a quintet.
Most recently, (G)I-DLE released its sixth mini album, titled ""I Feel,"" which sold over 1.16 million copies during the first week of release in May. The official music video for the main track, ""Queencard,"" has also garnered a jaw-dropping 119 million views on YouTube."
PETRONAS Chemicals announces FID to acquire MAn plant from BASF,2023-06-15T08:43:43.000000000+00:00,"PETRONAS Chemicals Group Berhad (PCG) has reached the final investment decision (FID) to fully acquire the 113 kilo-tonnes per annum (ktpa) Maleic Anhydride (MAn) plant located in Gebeng, Kuantan, Malaysia, from BASF PETRONAS Chemicals Sdn. Bhd. (BPC).
The plant will broaden PCG’s product portfolio and its derivatives to further strengthen PCG’s derivatives product offerings. The final investment decision signifies the start of the plant’s project execution phase that will upgrade and rejuvenate the facilities to produce refined Maleic Anhydride, which is targeted to be ready by the second half of 2025.
“The FID on the MAn plant signifies the strong commitment towards capturing new growth opportunities through diversification into derivatives and specialty chemicals. This will also allow us to produce MAn to meet rising demands from customers in Asia-Pacific and Indian subcontinents while exploring potential opportunities in European and Middle Eastern markets,” said PCG Managing Director and CEO Ir. Mohd Yusri Mohamed Yusof.
“Furthermore, the plant will enable future integration of MAn specialty chemical derivatives with both our subsidiaries Perstorp and BRB to deliver innovative solutions, along with possible synergies with other MAn downstream manufacturers in Malaysia,” said Yusri.
MAn is mainly used in the production of unsaturated polyester resins, paints, and food flavouring. The MAn plant, previously managed by PCG’s joint venture company, BPC will now be operated by PCG’s subsidiary, PETRONAS Chemicals MTBE Sdn. Bhd., following the completion of acquisition."
Switzerland’s New Inflation Forecast Supports Another SNB Hike,2023-06-15T08:42:00.000000000+00:00,"Switzerland’s government expects inflation to be above the central bank’s target this year — a forecast which reinforces a likely interest-rate hike next week.
The State Secretariat for Economic Affairs said consumer prices will rise 2.3% this year. That down from 2022’s 2.8%, and also slightly lower than a March prediction of 2.4%. SECO, which draws up economic projections for the government, maintained its 1.5% estimate for 2024.
It stuck with calls for economic output, predicting growth of 1.1% this year and 1.5% in 2024.
Swiss Government Sees Inflation Staying Strong This Year
Source: Bloomberg, SECO
“The Swiss economy started the year vigorously, and energy prices continue to fall,” SECO said in a statement. “However, inflationary pressures remain high internationally and there are pronounced economic risks.”
Switzerland has the lowest inflation rate of any advanced economy. Still, Swiss National Bank President Thomas Jordan recently warned that price pressures prove more sticky than expected and therefore the fight “is not over yet.”
The central bank meets for its next interest-rate decision in a week and is widely expected to raise borrowing costs by 25 basis points, with some economists even betting on a half-point move.
Published concurrently, the KOF summer forecast of ETH Zurich’s economics center highlighted that thanks to the recent rise in the reference interest rate for rents, “dues for many existing rental contracts will be sensitively increased next fall.”
In its forecast, KOF assumes that around half of inflation in 2024 will be caused by rent increases. It expects price growth of 2.2% for this year and 1.5% in 2024.
Swiss growth came in unexpectedly strong at 0.5% in the first quarter. But forward-looking indicators including an index of purchasing managers have been pointing toward a slowdown amid subdued industry sentiment."

Toyota Testing GR Electric Sports Car With Manual Gearbox,2023-06-15T08:26:28.000000000+00:00,"In December 2021, Toyota held a media briefing to show no fewer than 15 electric vehicles in concept form. Some of them have evolved into road-going models but there’s one that has yet to see the light of production day. Pictured here, the Sports EV hinted at an electric sports car with a targa top and Gazoo Racing branding. Last month, an updated product roadmap for zero-emission models included a performance vehicle set to arrive by 2026.
With that in mind, it shouldn't come as a big surprise Toyota is already testing an electric GR sports car. Company chairman Akio Toyoda told Autocar he had the opportunity to drive a prototype, but he's not sure whether it's this project that will come to fruition in three years' time. Regardless if it'll be this car or another, the former CEO said it needs to be fun to drive to be worthy of the GR badge even if it lacks a combustion engine.
Toyota Sports EV
Interestingly, Toyoda said one of the objectives is to give it a manual gearbox, complete with a clutch pedal. Not only that but the performance EV is also slated to make ""engine noises even if you can't smell gasoline."" The similarities with a conventionally powered sports car will be so significant that people won't be able to tell whether the vehicle is ICE or EV.
Lest we forget Toyota's luxury division Lexus has also previewed a zero-emission sports car of its own. The Electrified Sport Concept is expected to be an EV successor to the V10-powered LFA and has already been confirmed to get a manual with a third pedal and even a tachometer. The subsequent production version is going to have steer-by-wire and brake-by-wire systems, along with all-wheel drive, which means one electric motor at the front and another at the rear. With the concept, Lexus promised a 0 to 62 mph (100 km/h) sprint in the low two-second range and a range of over 435 miles (700 kilometers).
Logic tells us the road-going Electrified Sport from Lexus will be far more expensive than Toyota's electric GR sports car, which Toyoda said will look like an EV on the outside. The two Japanese brands have been talking about solid-state batteries for a while and they're more likely to go into the LFA's indirect replacement. By the way, Autocar speculates will cost from £500,000 ($633,000 at current exchange rates), thus making it far more expensive than the LFA's original £350,000 sticker.
At the beginning of the month, newly appointed Toyota CEO and President Koji Sato announced additional GR models are planned. For last weekend's 24 Hours of Le Mans, a GR Prius Concept was exhibited, although there’s no word about a production model just yet. Speaking of the endurance race, the GR H2 Racing Concept previews a hydrogen-powered machine that will race on the Circuit de la Sarthe in 2026."
MeitY collaborates with Google for online safety campaign,2023-06-15T08:25:00.000000000+00:00,"The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) and Google have announced a collaboration on cyber safety where Google will now work with the government to amplify its “Stay Safe Online” campaign.
Google will launch a series of videos featuring YouTube creators to educate users to responsibly share information online. The series will delve into specific skills to better evaluate the quality of information available online.
Creators will shed light on how to establish credentials of the source and understand their motivations, corroborate content with subject-matter experts, and gather cited and verifiable evidence. Additionally, YouTube has also established a digital literacy program called “Hit Pause”, which promotes critical thinking about online information.
“India's G20 Presidency offers a remarkable opportunity to shape a model of the internet that promotes inclusivity and establish new global standards,” Akash Tripathi, CEO of MyGov said. He added that with this growth came a need to raise awareness among the citizens about online risks and that the government was pleased to have Google join in with the effort.
“India is taking big strides towards its goal of becoming a trillion dollar digital economy. With over 700 million Indians using the internet, and the country driving transformative innovations with the power of digital technologies, it is important to ensure that the internet is inclusive and safe for all Indians,” Sanjay Gupta, Vice President of Google India said.
He added that the top priority at Google was to ensure a safe and helpful internet experience while supporting India’s digital growth.
Google has also said that it would be raising awareness of online safety through the “Be Internet Awesome” program sharing helpful content covering a wide range of online safety topics. These will be shared across the Google Safety Centre which serves as a single destination dedicated to educating users on the importance of digital safety, available in eight Indian languages.

Amazon Prime vs Prime Lite: Find out which Amazon subscription suits you better,2023-06-15T08:24:00.000000000+00:00,"Amazon recently announced a new, more affordable membership tier in India called 'Prime Lite'. Amazon Prime Lite is a cheaper version of the e-commerce giant's original 'Prime' membership.
Considering Prime Lite is a more affordable membership plan, there are some noticeable concessions. So let's look at the two membership plans and see which of the two is more suitable for audiences.
Amazon Prime vs Prime Lite
First off, let's look at the pricing of the two plans. An Amazon Prime membership price is set at Rs 1,499 for a year or Rs 299 per month or Rs 599 a quarter. On the other hand, the Amazon Prime Lite subscription price is set at Rs 999 for the entire year, although there's no monthly option.
Prime Lite shares most of the same benefits as a full-fledged Prime membership, including Free Delivery to Eligible Addresses, Discounted Delivery to Eligible Addresses, Amazon Pay ICICI Bank Credit Card, Amazon Prime Video, and Prime Early Access Exclusive Deals.
What are the Advantages of Amazon Prime?
However, Amazon Prime has a few more benefits over the Prime Lite subscription. These include Prime Advantage, which offers subscribers access to No Cost EMI payment on smartphones and six-month free screen replacement. You also get access to Amazon Family offers with Prime.
Moreover, Prime also provides access to 'Gaming Offers"", including free in-game content. You also get access to Prime Reading catalogue on the various platforms. Lastly, an Amazon Music subscription is also accessible for full-fledged Prime membership.
Amazon Prime vs Prime Lite: Which one should you get?
An Amazon Prime Lite subscription is an excellent option for the average customer. You have access to the best aspects of the Amazon Prime, while cutting out most of the excess. Apart from Amazon Music and Prime Reading, there are no other major benefits with a full Prime membership.
Additionally, Prime Lite isn't ad-free and supports watching Prime Video on two screens in HD resolution as opposed to 4K UHD on Prime. Moreover, the No Cost EMI option and free six-month screen replacement with Prime will come in handy when purchasing a smartphone. One-day or same-day delivery isn't offered with Prime Lite."

“We continue to evaluate new investment opportunities. Despite the volatility of recent months, we see a number of strong tailwinds in certain sectors — particularly those that solve big societal problems. One such problem is growing healthcare costs, which will put more pressure on social-security systems and household budgets. Later in this letter we profile Henry Schein, Inc. (NASDAQ:HSIC), the largest distributor of dental and medical products and services globally. Companies like Henry Schein have the potential to control the growth in healthcare costs, while promoting access to underserved communities.
At the same time, healthcare cost pressures are escalating. To make matters worse, healthcare has worse labour shortages than most industries, while productivity improvements are hard to come by.4 In almost every country, health spending is forecast to form an increasing share of GDP in the coming years.
At Generation, we look for companies that can provide a solution to these long-term challenges. More specifically, we look for healthcare companies that reduce costs and drive efficiency; that improve clinical outcomes; and that improve access to care. Henry Schein, a long-term holding of your portfolio, is an example of a company that we believe can deliver on all three of these criteria…” (Click here to read the full text)

"Glory to Hong Kong: Protest anthem removed from iTunes, Spotify",2023-06-15T08:17:00.000000000+00:00,"The unofficial anthem of Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests in 2019 has been removed from streaming platforms ahead of a court order that may ban the song.
Glory to Hong Kong had topped the city's iTunes chart last week after the government announced its intention to blacklist the song on security grounds.
On Wednesday recordings disappeared from Spotify and iTunes.
The tune has been targeted by authorities after being played in place of the Chinese anthem at some events.
Critics say the anticipated ban is another sign of Beijing's crackdown and efforts to stamp out dissent in Hong Kong against the central Chinese government.
If Glory to Hong Kong is banned, anyone involved in the broadcast, performance, sale or distribution of the song, including on the internet, could be charged under the city's National Security Law.
Hong Kong, a former British colony, is a Special Administrative Region of China and its residents are supposed to enjoy wider freedoms compared to the Chinese mainland. However, advocates say democratic freedoms have been eroded in recent years.
On Thursday, in response to reports, Spotify clarified the song had been removed by the distributor - the middleman company which handled the song's licensing to music platforms.
The composer of the song had earlier told the BBC he had not asked for the song to be taken down.
The protest tune was written in Cantonese during the 2019 demonstrations. It includes the lyrics: ""Revolution of our times. May people reign, proud and free, now and evermore. Glory be to thee Hong Kong"".
Many locals in Hong Kong had rushed to download the song in recent days as a court ban loomed.
A court was due to issue a ruling on Monday, but this was postponed after the judge asked the Hong Kong government to be more specific in the scope of its request.
For months, authorities have tried to erase or mask all traces of the tune online. Glory to Hong Kong has been banned in schools since 2020.
The Hong Kong government has also to have the song removed or ranked lower in search results.
But rights groups say the song is ."

Copyright infringement lawsuit. Twitter sued by music publishers for allowing copyrighted songs,2023-06-15T08:12:18.000000000+00:00,"A group of 17 music publishers sued Twitter in Nashville, Tennessee, federal court, accusing the company of enabling thousands of copyright violations by allowing users to post music without a license. Twitter drives user engagement with ""countless infringing copies of musical compositions,"" the lawsuit said.
Members of the National Music Publishers' Association (NMPA), including Sony Music Publishing, BMG Rights Management, and Universal Music Publishing Group, seek more than $250 million in damages for alleged infringement of nearly 1,700 copyrights. The lawsuit said the longstanding infringement has gotten worse since Elon Musk bought Twitter, and that other major platforms like TikTok, Facebook, and YouTube properly license music from the publishers.
Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

NMPA President David Israelite said in a statement that Twitter ""stands alone as the largest social media platform that has completely refused to license the millions of songs on its service.""
The microblogging platform ""routinely ignores"" repeat infringement by users who post tweets that contain unlicensed music, the lawsuit said. The publishers said Twitter encourages user infringement, which increases engagement and ad revenues while giving it an ""unfair advantage"" over platforms that pay for music licenses.
""Twitter's internal affairs regarding matters pertinent to this case are in disarray,"" the publishers said, noting deep cuts to the company's legal and trust-and-safety teams since Musk took control."

H&M gained as much as 6.9% after second-quarter revenue exceeded pre-pandemic levels and the Swedish clothing chain said June got off to a good start.
Asos surged as much as 16% after returning to profit. The UK e-commerce retailer forecast as much as £60 million ($76 million) of adjusted operating income in the second half as it cuts inventory and boosts its underperforming brands and markets.
Chief Executive Officer Jose Antonio Ramos Calamonte is trying to overhaul Asos as speculation swirls around the future of the retailer, whose value has shrunk about 90% in the past three years. Billionaire Mike Ashley, majority holder of Frasers Group Plc, raised his stake in recent weeks after Anders Povlsen, who owns Danish fashion group Bestseller, took part in an equity raise.

H&M’s sales were flat in the three months through May as cold spring weather weighed on shoppers’ purchases, the retailer said Thursday. Revenue of 57.62 billion kronor ($5.4 billion) means it’s the first quarter for H&M to report that business has recovered entirely from the pandemic.
The Swedish retailer is struggling to match sales growth of Zara chain owner Inditex SA, which last week reported a 15% rise in revenue for the three months through April. H&M has been trying to gain new clients with a collection with fashion house Mugler that went on sale last month.
Jeffries analysts James Grzinic and Frederick Wild said H&M’s figures were a “little less downbeat than feared” but were worse than rivals, partly because of H&M’s exposure to northern Europe, which had a cold May."
Ghana's local currency ratings upgraded by Moody's,2023-06-15T08:10:00.000000000+00:00,"Moody's Investors Service has upgraded the Government of Ghana's local currency long-term issuer rating from Ca to Caa3, with a stable outlook.
The local currency senior unsecured MTN program rating has also been upgraded from (P)Ca to (P)Caa3.
The upgrade follows the completion of the government's primary local currency debt restructuring, which has reduced the expected losses on local currency debt in the future. The debt exchange has also provided Ghana with some fiscal relief, reducing the likelihood of seeking another debt restructuring of a similar scale from the same creditors in the near to medium term.
However, the Caa3 rating still reflects the existing risk of potential default, which remains a tangible concern until Ghana settles its local currency debt that has not undergone restructuring and restructures its foreign currency debt.
The stable outlook indicates a balance between downside and upside risks. On the one hand, prolonged negotiations regarding the restructuring of the government's foreign currency debt and increasing limitations on accessing local currency funding pose downside risks that could result in a more significant loss than indicated by the Caa3 rating in another local currency debt restructuring.
On the other hand, there is the possibility of a relatively smooth foreign currency debt restructuring process, coupled with Ghana's fiscal and external adjustment supported by the official sector, including the IMF. These factors contribute to the balanced outlook.
The upgrade by Moody's is a positive development for Ghana, but it is important to note that the country still faces significant challenges. The government will need to continue to implement its economic reforms and work to restructure its foreign currency debt in order to improve its credit rating and access to capital markets."

H&M sales flatline as cool weather hit demand for summer clothing,2023-06-15T08:08:05.000000000+00:00,"F
ashion chain H&M has revealed weaker-than-expected sales over the latest quarter after demand was weighed down by chilly weather.
The Swedish retail giant, however, added that June trading has started well amid improving conditions, driving an increase in shares in early trading.
It told investors on Thursday morning that net sales were “flattish compared with last year” over the three months to May 31, with revenues to 57.61 billion Swedish kronor (£4.24 billion).
Analysts had predicted the company would report a 1% sales increase for the period, after H&M had already flagged in late March that demand for spring and summer styles was being impacted by cooler weather.
In a statement, the firm said: “Sales in the second quarter were affected by unfavourable weather conditions compared to the corresponding period last year on several of the H&M group’s large markets.
“June has got off to a good start.”
Analysts from Jefferies said: “This is a clear lag to global peers, partly explained by a more mature US footprint and the impact of cold weather in May in parts of Northern Europe.”
It comes a week after Spanish rival Inditex, which owns Zara, revealed a 13% surge in sales – up 15% with currency movements stripped out – over the year to April as it shrugged off pressures on consumer finances.
Inditex had said sales growth remained in double digits, up 16% on a constant currency basis, since May 1 as it said “spring/summer collections continue to be very well received by our customers”."
SoftBank-Backed Indian Eyewear Unicorn Gets $100M Funding Boost From ChrysCapital,2023-06-15T08:06:00.000000000+00:00,"This story was first published on the Benzinga India Portal.
Indian eyewear startup Lenskart has raised $100 million in funding from private equity firm ChrysCapital, through primary and secondary share sales.
What Happened? The latest funding brings the total investment in the SoftBank Group Corp-backed
omnichannel eyewear firm to $850 million in the last year, according to a statement.
Lenskart’s future plans include the establishment of a new factory to manufacture and ship 20 million pairs of eyewear next year, further boosting its production capacity. Despite reporting losses in FY22, Lenskart remains confident in its growth prospects.
“This investment aligns with ChrysCapital's strategy of backing founders that are category creators and who leverage technology to offer an outstanding customer experience,” said Rajiv Batra, senior vice president at ChrysCapital Advisors.
The latest fundraise comes after Lenskart recently raised $500 million from a subsidiary of Abu Dhabi Investment Authority at its current valuation of $4.5 billion, solidifying its position as one of the most well-funded startups in India’s eyewear industry. At the time, the company had said its revenue grew by 60% for the second year in a row and it was profitable.

Lenskart currently competes with Tata’s Titan Eyeplus and is set to face a challenge from Reliance Retail‘s entry into the eyewear space.
India’s eyewear market is highly competitive, with players like Coolwinks, Lawrence & Mayo, GKB Lens, and Ray-Ban vying for market share alongside Lenskart. However, with its substantial funding, Lenskart is well-positioned to scale its operations and expand its offline presence.
Lenskart has a customer base of 20 million users across India and is also exploring international markets in Asia, the Middle East, and other regions.
Founded in 2008, Lenskart became a unicorn in 2019 and has attracted investments from prominent firms such as SoftBank, Alpha Wave Global, Temasek, KKR, and TPG.

Colliers has outperformed the market this year despite the stock being down ~15% from its mid-February highs. The company reported better than expected results and issued better than feared guidance, and the stock was briefly rewarded, before giving it all back over the following month. Investors are clearly worried about anything commercial real estate related given the enormous stress in the regional banking sector and a wall of debt coming due in 2024 that will require refinancing.

Acquia Enhances Digital Experience Platform to Power Omnichannel Customer Journeys,2023-06-15T08:00:00.000000000+00:00,"Acquia Enhances Digital Experience Platform to Power Omnichannel Customer Journeys
Acquia has enhanced the capabilities of its market-leading digital experience platform, Acquia DXP, to create richer, more personalized experiences for customers. Acquia introduced the new capability today at Acquia Engage Paris, the company’s customer and partner event.
As brands engage with their customers across more and more touchpoints, they are faced with the challenge of collecting and leveraging the behavioral data available from these disparate sources. Marketers commonly struggle with challenges such as:
Personalizing customer journeys of anonymous visitors as they become known and understood. By continuously collecting behavioral data, marketers can assemble it into a single profile view. This improves as additional identifying information becomes available, allowing the visitor to progress from anonymous to known to understood.
Consolidating all IDs associated with a unique individual, regardless of channel and device. As a customer moves among channels, multiple tracking IDs are generated through interactions with different systems and potentially from multiple client devices. The marketer needs unified, 360 profiles of these known customers that leverage all customer activity.
Creating responses to customer actions that take into account interactions at every touch point. For example, marketers want to use behavioral data from the website to make product recommendations based on past interactions, even before the customer has been identified. Campaigns such as these can help improve conversion rates.
The combined power of the customer data platform (Acquia CDP) and Acquia Personalization enables Acquia customers to create digital experiences based on knowledge gained from a much broader array of channels, making the most of their anonymous, known and understood customer data.
“Marketing teams that use a CDP as a point product commonly struggle to take full advantage of data from multiple channels,” said Mark Picone, SVP and General Manager, Acquia Marketing Cloud. “Acquia has closed this gap, making it possible for marketers to assemble more sophisticated digital experiences by enabling better personalization and segmentation for all customers, regardless of digital channel. This allows them to design more effective campaigns that better reflect the way their own customers interact with the brand.”
A Modular, Composable Platform
Acquia CDP and Acquia Personalization are available standalone or within Acquia DXP. Both products support composable customer data strategies through integrations with other Acquia and third-party marketing products. They are foundations of the industry’s only open DXP for bringing together content and data to create world-class customer experiences.

Jim Coleman of We Are Social: Top Tips for Cannes,2023-06-15T08:00:00.000000000+00:00,"Top Tips for Cannes
Skinny/Phone it in
For a long time we’ve needed lightness and fun back in advertising. This ‘Phone it in’ campaign from Skinny does this perfectly, by allowing anyone in New Zealand to record Skinny radio ads on their mobile phones for free.
Getting ordinary folk to do their advertising fits beautifully with their brand positioning – it’s a low cost telco which claims not to be able to compete with the big names when it comes to ad spend, so they’ve found a way to be both efficient and funny.
Skinny has been doing interesting, different ads for some time – and this work actually has the talkability we are all striving for from any campaign. Ads like this are really what Cannes should be celebrating – clever, results-driven advertising.
Apple/The Greatest
From a more purpose-focused perspective, Apple’s ‘The Greatest’ stands out for me. A tiny 4% of TV adverts in the UK feature disabled people, despite 22% of the population being disabled. The ad shows people with disabilities ranging from vision, hearing, mobility and cognitive using Apple’s tech to help them in their everyday lives.
Purpose-focused ads often do well at Cannes, but often that’ll be a result of a brand piggybacking on a cause with a fairly tenuous link back to its values. This doesn’t feel like an ad created for awards – it’s a genuinely great piece of content that shows real utility in Apple’s products (as Apple’s ads often do). It also heroes its talent as people who’ve been supercharged by Apple products. An inspiring watch.

BBC Breakfast’s Naga Munchetty kicks unsuspecting Charlie Stayt after mortifying on-air blunder,2023-06-15T07:56:53.000000000+00:00,"BBC Breakfast viewers saw a sneaky comedy jab between co-hosts this morning as Naga Munchetty tried to get Charlie Stayt's attention.

During a guest interview segment on BBC Breakfast with barrister Victoria Butler-Cole, Naga tried to engage with Charlie, who was otherwise distracted.
The interview followed a short news segment showcasing issues with accessing child trust funds for families with disabled children.
Naga started the interview off with a split screen appearing to spotlight the morning anchor and the guest.
However, the shot soon changed to a wide angle back in the studio with Naga still engaged in the interview and co-host Charlie looking at the morning papers to get ahead of the following news item.

“In May 2021, we shared our thoughts on AI with a particular focus on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), expressing our belief that it was poised to become a significant enabler of AI technology. At the time, it felt like our insights were being carried away by the wind.
Our thesis hinged on the idea that NVIDIA's GPUs would form the fundamental computing hardware for neural networks. This hardware would not only develop AI tools and infrastructure but also democratise access to AI technology.
At the end of that letter, we included a substantial excerpt from an interview with NVIDIA's CEO, Jensen Huang. Looking back, his words now seem eerily prophetic. He suggested, albeit vaguely, a solution to the complexity problem. He said:
“But finally, we have this piece of this new technology called artificial intelligence that can write that complex software so that we can automate it. The whole goal of writing software is to automate something. We’re in this new world where, over the next 10 years, we’re going to see the automation of automation””…(Click here to read the full text)

The merger of Vodafone Group PLC

UK telecommunication businesses has reportedly come under the scrutiny of UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).
After months of speculation, the companies officially disclosed the merger of their UK businesses yesterday.
Post-merger of Vodafone UK and Three UK, Vodafone will own 51% of the combined business, and CKHGT will have the remaining 49%.
As per Reuters, the companies will need approval under a National Security and Investment Act, which provides the British government powers to intervene in deals, posing a risk.
The report cited analyst Paolo Pescatore at PP Foresight, showing concern about the probability of the merger getting a green flag from the authorities, given both companies' UK businesses have been outperforming the market.
Notably, the UK telecom regulator and EU authorities opposed Hutchison's deal with Telefonica SA TEF years ago.

"Twitch and Kick streamer Pamaj parts ways with FaZe Clan amidst recent controversy, implies the organization has ""changed""",2023-06-15T07:48:00.000000000+00:00,"Twitch and Kick streamer Austin Pamajewo, also known as Pamaj, recently made a major announcement, declaring his departure from the FaZe Clan, an organization he initially joined in 2012, before reuniting with them in 2018. The streamer took to his YouTube account (3.2 million subscribers) yesterday (June 14) to share the details.
Before his departure, the streamer served as a content creator for the organization. He said the decision was not easy, considering his long-standing association with the team. Furthermore, he hinted that the dynamics and atmosphere within the group had changed since his initial joining. He stated:
""It's not as easy as it looks. I gotta be honest with you, it never is. I don't want to fan the flame or give in to whatever has been happening with the clan and the team as a whole, as you guys have seen.""
Why did Pamaj leave the FaZe Clan? Streamer explains
FaZe Clan has been facing a period of turmoil recently. One of its members, FaZe Rain, used his YouTube channel to criticize the management publicly and even disclosed the clan's financial figures, revealing a substantial loss.
Additionally, a rift has emerged between FaZe Rain and Grace Van Dien, a recently appointed member of the FaZe Clan who transitioned from being an actress to a streamer.
Amidst all the drama, Pamaj took a moment to reflect and shared his thoughts, stating:
""I want to say thanks for the opportunity to join back. They've given me a home but this is not the same team when I first joined. It doesn't feel the same.""
Pamaj has officially left FaZe Clan

He added:
""This decision, I'm really just choosing me. I've been quite unhappy with myself, with sort of my surroundings and it's kind of just where life has taken me I guess.""
While acknowledging that the organization hasn't been its former self, Pamaj shared his belief in the team's potential and extended well wishes to everyone involved, hoping for their success in the future.
In addition, he expressed his gratitude towards some of the original members of the clan, including FaZe Temperrr, FaZe Banks, FaZe Rain, and FaZe Apex.
Fans react to the departure
The news of Pamaj's departure was amplified by online reporter Jake Lucky (@JakeSucky). His tweet garnered a host of replies, with many hinting that he may rejoin OpTic Clan. Here are some notable reactions:
Despite having a significant following of 393K on Twitch, the streamer now mainly streams on the newly launched Kick platform (2.1K followers)."
Is It Time To Consider Buying RTL Group S.A. (ETR:RRTL)?,2023-06-15T07:48:00.000000000+00:00,"RTL Group S.A. (ETR:RRTL), is not the largest company out there, but it received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the XTRA over the last few months, increasing to €49.24 at one point, and dropping to the lows of €36.34. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether RTL Group's current trading price of €38.34 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at RTL Group’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.
What Is RTL Group Worth?
Great news for investors – RTL Group is still trading at a fairly cheap price according to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that RTL Group’s ratio of 8.82x is below its peer average of 18.67x, which indicates the stock is trading at a lower price compared to the Media industry. RTL Group’s share price also seems relatively stable compared to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. If you believe the share price should eventually reach its industry peers, a low beta could suggest it is unlikely to rapidly do so anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range.
Can we expect growth from RTL Group?
Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Though in the case of RTL Group, it is expected to deliver a relatively unexciting earnings growth of 5.9%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. Growth doesn’t appear to be a main reason for a buy decision for the company, at least in the near term.
So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing. For example - RTL Group has we think you should be aware of.

JP Morgan Reiterates Negative View On IT Sector,2023-06-15T07:48:00.000000000+00:00,"Leading global stock-broking firm JP Morgan has reiterated its negative view on information technology (IT) sector. It believes that IT companies will disappoint the market in Q1 of FY24 but it also sees the technology firms upsetting the Dalal Street in the second half of FY24.
The foreign brokerage firm has placed IT majors like Infosys, TCS and Mphasis on a negative catalyst watch, as per a report published in Moneycontrol portal.
The sectoral index, which has been on a downward trend since June 1, is down at 28,741.70 at 11:05 am, while Infosys and TCS are down 1.11% and 0.62%, Mphasis is marginally up 0.40% to remain in the green.
It is noteworthy that in the recent past, several analysts have highlighted that the sector is vulnerable to global headwinds. In the recent when the March quarter results were shared, the performance of the IT companies did not meet the street expectations and was disappointing.
The performance of Tier-1 technology firms in the March quarter was muted with the revenue growth ranging between -3.2 and 0.6 per cent, pointed out domestic brokerage firm Sharekhan. For instance, the Bengaluru-based Infosys' revenue declined by over 2 per cent QoQ. Moreover, it has now set single-digit growth guidance in the range of 4-7 per cent for FY24.
""The delayed spending in a few segments, concerns in BFSI, and fears over a global economic slowdown is impacting the overall performance of the sector. On the valuation front, over the past 1.5 years, the industry valuations have been corrected by more than a third,"" said Vinod T.P., a research analyst at Geojit Financial Services."
Karnataka HC threatens to close down Facebook in India; here’s why,2023-06-15T07:47:00.000000000+00:00,"The Karnataka High Court has issued a warning to Facebook, indicating that it may consider taking measures to shut down the social media giant's operations in India.
This action comes as a response to Facebook's alleged lack of cooperation with the state police in relation to the investigation of a case involving an imprisoned Indian citizen in Saudi Arabia, according to reports from news agency IANS.
In addition, the court instructed the Central government to provide details regarding the steps taken thus far in response to the arrest of an Indian citizen under false charges. The Mangaluru police were also directed to conduct a thorough investigation and submit a report. The court adjourned the hearing to June 22.

The court issued the warning while addressing a petition submitted by Kavitha, a resident of Bikarnakatte near Mangaluru. The court directed Facebook to submit a comprehensive report containing the necessary information within a week.
In her plea, Kavitha explained that her husband, Shailesh Kumar, had been employed with a company in Saudi Arabia for 25 years, while she resided in their native place with their children. She revealed that Kumar had posted a message on Facebook expressing support for the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) in 2019.
Subsequently, an unknown individual created a fake Facebook account in his name and posted objectionable content targeting the King of Saudi Arabia and Islam.

Upon learning of this fraudulent account, Kumar informed his family, and Kavitha filed a police complaint in Mangaluru. However, Saudi authorities arrested Shailesh Kumar and imprisoned him. The Mangaluru police initiated an investigation and sought information from Facebook regarding the creation of the fake account. Regrettably, Facebook did not respond to the police's inquiries.
In 2021, Kavitha approached the High Court, expressing concern over the delay in the investigation. She also wrote a letter to the central government seeking assistance in securing her husband's release from prison."

H&M's March-May sales lag expectations,2023-06-15T07:45:00.000000000+00:00,"Sweden's H&M reported on Thursday unchanged second-quarter sales measured in local currencies, slightly lagging expectations as unusually chilly weather held back demand.
Analysts had on average forecasted a year-on-year rise of 1% after H&M flagged already in late March that cold weather in many key markets was dampening demand for spring and summer styles.
The unchanged local currency turnover is a slowdown from the previous quarter, as well as from 2022.
""Sales in the second quarter were affected by unfavourable weather conditions compared to the corresponding period last year on several of the H&M group's large markets"" H&M said in a statement.
Net sales at the world's second-biggest fashion retailer after Zara owner Inditex were up 6% to 57.6bn crowns (€4.96bn) against a forecast 7% rise.
H&M said sales in June, the first month of its third quarter, had got off to a good start. The group in 2022 launched a savings drive after a spike in costs which it has only partly been passing on to cash-strapped customers, and its sales growth has been lagging behind that of Inditex as well as online players such as fast-expanding Shein.
Inditex, which has coped better than H&M in sluggish markets, last week said net sales in its quarter through April were up 13% and, in May, up 16%.
H&M, whose single-biggest market is Germany, is due to publish its full quarterly earnings report on June 29.

Binance Launches BTC Cloud Mining Product outside US,2023-06-15T07:44:00.000000000+00:00,"Binance crypto exchange has expanded its offerings by launching new subscription-based cryptocurrency mining products for users outside the United States.
“Binance is launching a new batch of Cloud Mining products for BTC mining,” the exchange stated in the announcement today (Thursday). “Users may now complete subscriptions to Cloud Mining products to purchase hashrates, and start accumulating mining rewards in their Funding Wallets.”
The crypto exchange is selling a minimum of 1 Terahash per second (Th/s) unit at $10.7280, which has been split between the hashrate fee and electricity cost of $1.17 and $9.558, respectively. The mining duration will be 180 days, and the estimated output in the period is 0.0004338 BTC.
Binance jumped into the crypto mining space years ago with the launch of its mining pool. However, its cloud mining products came recently, allowing users to get into crypto mining without the hassle of maintaining a mining infrastructure.
The cloud mining product has been launched on Binance.com, the global crypto exchange website operating outside the United States.
Binance’s Troubles with the Regulators
Binance has long maintained that Binance.com operates separately from its US affiliate. However, a recent lawsuit from the US securities regulator alleged that Binance.com and the CEO, Changpeng Zhao control all the operations at Binance.US.
The Securities and Exchange Commission allegations against Binance, its two US affiliates and the CEO, Zhao of operating illegal trading platforms, offering unregistered crypto asset securities, and commingling customers’ funds. The regulator is now seeking a court order to freeze the assets of Binance.US, but the two parties have moved to the negotiating table as such a step would cripple the exchange’s US operations.
Meanwhile, Binance has applied for the deregistration of its local unit in Cyprus, which obtained a license last October."
House Democrat Sharply Takes Down GOP With 1 Mega Trump Zinger,2023-06-15T07:43:00.000000000+00:00,"Rep. Jared Moskowitz (D-Fla.) took a dig at GOP lawmakers on Wednesday as he joked that former President Donald Trump has showered with “nuclear codes.”
The Democrat made the roast at a House Oversight Committee hearing on government regulations just one day after Trump was arraigned on 37 federal charges linked to his handling of classified documents.

“And all we want to do is go back to Trump, I mean every hearing it’s like ‘if we could just go back to what Trump did’ – the loser of the 2020 election, the loser of the Georgia Senate races, the loser of the 2018 midterms,” Moskowitz said as he mocked Republicans.
Moskowitz went on to note that the Trump administration finalized more federal rules in its last year than any other final year of any presidency in history before poking fun at the 2024 candidate.
“I know it’s inconvenient timing but perhaps we actually need more regulation with Presidents taking nuclear codes and cuddling with them and showering with them in their homes,” Moskowitz said.

Legal and General: Santander Europe boss António Simões to succeed long-time chief Sir Nigel Wilson,2023-06-15T07:42:00.000000000+00:00,"Legal and General (L&G) has appointed Santander’s António Simões to be chief executive, who will succeed the departing Sir Nigel Wilson next year.
Simões has been Santander’s European regional head since 2020, leading the bank’s operations across the UK, Spain and Portugal. Before that Simões had been at HSBC for 13 years, where he had been chief executive of its UK and Europe business.
He will take up the post at the beginning of next year with Wilson remaining in post in the meantime to deliver a “comprehensive handover and a smooth transition”.
Chair of L&G Sir John Kingman said: “António brings a formidable leadership track record at the most senior level of financial services, working across complex, global organisations.
“In an excellent field, his energy, ambition and clarity of strategic thinking stood out, alongside his strong belief in the positive role that business should play in society,” Kingman continued.
Simões said “This is a critical time for our industry, clients and customers, with emerging technologies, changing societal dynamics and wider economic forces presenting new challenges and opportunities that require all of us to adapt and evolve.”
Wilson had been at the helm of L&G for over a decade, leading the business through an often difficult environment. He announced his departure in January this year.
Simões will receive a salary of £1.2m in the role with his first pay review will taking place in 2025. Each year, depending on performance, he will be eligible for an annual bonus up to a potential £2.4m and long-term incentive share awards worth up to £3.5m."
Players at a crossroads entering 2023 NFL season,2023-06-15T07:39:06.000000000+00:00,"Jacobs has had quite a year. Last August, there was speculation about whether the Raiders wanted to trade him after declining his fifth-year option — something head coach Josh McDaniels said the team had no desire to do. By the end of the year, Jacobs had proven himself so valuable that the Raiders franchise-tagged him.
Jacobs led the NFL in rushing yards (1,653) and scored 12 rushing touchdowns in 2022, but he has yet to receive a lucrative extension offer to his liking (July 17 is the deadline for tagged players to sign a multi-year extension). If nothing changes on that front, he’ll have another chance to prove he is an essential part of the Raiders’ future playing on a one-year tender in 2023.
Running back continues to be devalued in the pass-happy NFL, but if he produces another top-tier season in ‘23, the Raiders might have a tough time justifying not paying him. On the other hand, if he doesn’t find as much success, the Raiders might have no problem moving on and leaving Jacobs to enter a market that hasn’t been friendly to the position."

However, shoppers in the city are less likely to use a mobile during their in-store shopping journey, compared to other Southeast Asian shoppers, with about 1 in 3 or even 1 in 4 of respondents doing this.

Set to make its debut on July 10, the Hyundai Exter will go on to become the company's most affordable SUV offering in India, sitting below the Venue in the Hyundai SUV portfolio.
Ahead of its launch, Hyundai has already revealed the design of the car digitally.This time around, the Korean carmaker has unveiled the interior of theExter for the first time, confirming that it will feature a dual display setup. The Hyundai Exter will be based on the same platform as the Grand i10 NIOS and Aura, and also seems to borrow their overall cabin layout.
Tata Altroz iCNG Review: Best CNG car in India! | TOI Auto
While the overall layout is similar to the Grand i10 NIOS, the all-black theme sets it apart. The Exter carries over the Grand i10 NIOS' eight-inch touchscreen infotainment system, surrounded by physical buttons, however, also gets a fully digital instrument cluster, which is borrowed from the i20. Apart from the dual displays, the Exter also gets cruise control, an electric sunroof, a wireless charger, automatic climate control, steering-mounted controls, rear AC vents and so on!
The Exter could even possibly become the most affordable car in India to be offered with an electric sunroof, however, the same will only be confirmed once the prices are made available. That said, Hyundai has revealed that the Exter will be offered with a sole 1.2-litre NA petrol engine - the same as Grand i10 NIOS and Aura. This engine makes 83 PS power, and is mated to a 5-speed manual transmission along with an optional AMT. A factory-fit CNG kit will also be offered as an extra option."
GameStop Removes CEO and Reports Larger-Than-Anticipated Quarterly Deficit,2023-06-15T07:35:19.000000000+00:00,"Billionaire Ryan Cohen, the bold investor who famously bet on GameStop and became a hero to meme stock traders, has taken over as Executive Chairman of the company following the ousting of its CEO and posting of a larger-than-expected quarterly loss. Despite Cohen’s track record of success with the online pet products retailer Chewy, some analysts remain skeptical about his ability to turn GameStop around. He will now have control over capital allocation, investments, acquisitions, and holdings oversight. The company’s top lawyer, Mark Robinson, has been named general manager and will report to Cohen.
In after-hours trading, GameStop’s stock price plunged by over 20%, continuing the roller-coaster ride of retail investor activity that started in early 2021. Meanwhile, industry analysts and investors are questioning Cohen’s ability to revive other retail companies, given his mixed track record of success at Bed Bath & Beyond and Nordstrom. The revolving door of executives at GameStop has also drawn concern, as many Cohen-hired executives have not lasted long.
While Cohen’s activism has expanded with bets on Alibaba, Nordstrom, and Bed Bath & Beyond, he is now being likened to Elon Musk running Twitter. Great Hill Capital LLC’s Chairman Thomas Hayes stated that, while meme traders love Cohen, his appointment as Executive Chairman was a hail mary pass for investors to count on the company’s revival. GameStop’s total net sales for the past quarter dipped 10%, making it the fourth consecutive decline in quarterly revenue.

Samsung announces the launch of Galaxy Watch 6 with AFib notifications later this year,2023-06-15T07:35:00.000000000+00:00,"In an announcement made by Samsung, the company confirmed the launch of its new smartwatch, which will have support for AFib notifications. According to the reports, this lineup will include the Galaxy Watch 6. With this announcement, Samsung is all set to introduce support for tracking irregular heart rhythm notifications. It is set to be introduced in 13 markets across the globe. This will begin later this year with the launch of One UI Watch 5. Gradually, this feature, which is now in its beta phase, will be supported on the Galaxy Watch 5, Galaxy Watch 4, and their variants.

This feature of Irregular Heart Rhythm Notifications on the Galaxy Watch will keep up with the signs of atrial fibrillation (AFib). This is a common heart condition that forms the basis of bigger issues. This is a feature that is notably offered by Fitbit products, Apple Watches, and other products of different brands. Samsung, however, is now all set to roll out its passive notification feature on the Galaxy Watch devices.
Samsung has received clearance from 13 markets across the world. This includes the U.S., South Korea, Argentina, Azerbaijan, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Georgia, Guatemala, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Panama, and the UAE. Before the feature is introduced in older products, the update will debut in the company’s new lineup of Galaxy Watches.
According to a study by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), atrial fibrillation is a very common heart disorder, also known as an arrhythmia. It accounts for about 20 to 30% of stroke cases and also significantly increases the risk of premature deaths. According to a post that was published on Apple’s support page in December 2022, one can enable the notifications through the Heart Rate app, which is available on Watch Series 1 or later for the age groups of 13 and above.
As per the blog post, the user’s heartbeat will occasionally be examined by the irregular rhythm notification feature on the Apple Watch to seek out an abnormal rhythm that could be AFib. This typically occurs while you’re still trying to get a more precise reading. The number of readings taken each day and the intervals between readings will vary depending on how busy you are.
Although AFib is a chronic illness, its duration might vary. People with AFib frequently lead active, healthy lives. Regular exercise, a heart-healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and getting treatment for underlying medical disorders can make your AFib better. All these have the potential to shorten the amount of time your heart is in AFib. AFib can cause heart failure or blood clots that may result in a stroke if left untreated. Early diagnosis and treatment can help avoid these consequences, and AFib can be managed with medical supervision and medication.

In the announcement made by Samsung, the company confirmed that “upcoming Galaxy Watch devices” will be the first with support for this new feature when they release “later this year.” As per the reports, the new lineup is anticipated to come with a new chipset, updated designs, and welcome back the “classic” model with a rotating bezel."

He'll likely make his next start Saturday night against Tennessee in Omaha, Nebraska. Skenes says the record is in the back of his mind but that he's more gratified by his chance to keep pitching for LSU on college baseball's biggest stage. Skenes has 188 strikeouts in 107 innings.

O'Sullivan says ""certainly, we’re pitching at a high level at the right time.” It’s been nearly flawless the last two weeks, raising outside expectations and making the Gators one of the favorites to reach the best-of-three championship series.

"Competition Act Will Apply To Coal India, Says Supreme Court",2023-06-15T07:29:00.000000000+00:00,"The Supreme Court on Thursday dismissed Coal India Ltd.'s case that the competition regulator has no jurisdiction over it.
The apex court dismissed the company's stance that the Competition Act, 2002, does not apply to it because it is governed by the Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act.
During the proceedings, Coal India argued that since its primary purpose is to serve the common good, it stands on a different footing than other corporations. Coal India must be treated differently than any other company that might have a monopoly since it works for the common benefit of people, the state-owned coal miner had said.
The case reached the apex court after the Competition Commission of India, in 2013, concluded that Coal India and its three subsidiaries —Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd., Western Coalfields Ltd., and South Eastern Coal fields Ltd. — were guilty of abusing their dominant position.
ADVERTISEMENT
The regulator had found that the state-run company and its subsidiaries supplied low-quality coal at high prices, retained the right to unilaterally terminate contracts with buyers, did not provide a fair dispute redressal mechanism, and preferred other state-owned companies over private buyers of coal.
The competition regulator had initially imposed a penalty of Rs 1733.05 crore, but after the Competition Appellate Tribunal sent the case back for fresh consideration, the fine was reduced to Rs 591.01 crore."
Toyota Chairman Re-Elected But Support Slips,2023-06-15T07:26:00.000000000+00:00,"Toyota Chairman Akio Toyoda was re-elected to the automaker's board, though his approval rating took a hit after some European and U.S. investor groups sought to oust the longtime leader.
Toyoda's renomination earned 85% support at the automaker's annual shareholder meeting, Toyota said Thursday. That was a drop from last year's 96% approval rating but far exceeded the majority required for re-election.
Some non-Japanese shareholders called for Toyoda's ouster, citing governance issues and the role they say he played in keeping the automaker from going all-in on EVs.
A shareholder proposal to make Toyota management reveal more about the automaker's climate-related lobbying activities earned 15% support, falling short of the two-thirds majority required for the resolution to be approved.

Binance launches Bitcoin mining cloud services amid SEC crackdown in the US,2023-06-15T07:24:00.000000000+00:00,"Crypto exchange Binance announced the launch of new subscription-based could mining products dedicated to Bitcoin (BTC) mining.
Starting June 15, users that are interested in Bitcoin mining but lack the equipment can subscribe to Binance’s cloud mining services and purchase hashrates for the same. Hashrate is the computing power required for confirming and legitimizing Bitcoin transactions over the blockchain.
Binance is currently selling 1 Terahash per second (Th/s) at $10.7280, which is split between the hashrate and electricity costs at $1.17 and $9.558 respectively. A higher number of hashrate increases the probability of a higher income in terms of the Bitcoin earned through mining.
Binance’s BTC mining subscription service will be active for 180 days, or roughly six months. For each TH/s purchased, users will be able to earn 0.0004338 BTC during the timeline.
As the product is launched on Binance’s global website, the service is not available for crypto investors residing in the United States. In a previous statement to Cointelegraph about the recent Securities and Exchange Commission crackdown in the U.S., Binance clarified that “Binance.com is a separate entity and our users will not be impacted by issues at Binance.US.”

To fight against the allegations of SEC, Binance.US hired former SEC enforcement co-director George Canellos as part of its legal team.
Reacting the alleged development, “Binance is clearly preparing for a criminal prosecution and continuing to hire the best defense attorneys in the world,” said former SEC internet enforcement chief John Reed Stark on Twitter.
The legal scrutiny began when SEC alleged that Binance’s US arm was operating as an unregistered exchange, broker and clearing agency. Following the SEC’s actions, on June 9, Binance.US announced the suspension of the U.S dollar deposits and potentially pausing fiat withdrawals starting as early as June 13.

Top US Chip Gearmaker Accuses China Rival of 14-Month Spy Spree,2023-06-15T07:24:00.000000000+00:00,"(Bloomberg) -- Applied Materials Inc. is suing a Chinese-owned rival over what it says was a 14-month effort to steal some of its most valuable secrets, allegedly including an orchestrated employee-poaching spree and surreptitious transfers of semiconductor equipment designs.

The biggest US supplier of chipmaking equipment accused Mattson, a Fremont, California-based company acquired by Beijing-backed Beijing E-Town Dragon Semiconductor Industry Investment Center in 2016, of hiring away 17 of its most senior engineers over just more than a year.
They included a senior department manager and researchers who collaborated for years and were privy to sensitive information such as chipmaking processes and the company’s technology roadmap, Santa Clara, California-based Applied Materials said in the court filings. It sued Mattson in 2022 as well as the latest employee to depart, whom the company said finally provided concrete evidence of espionage.
“Many of these documents are highly sensitive, technical, and contain Applied’s trade secrets and know-how which would give Mattson years of competitive advantage in its technology trajectory and development,” the US company said in a March 2022 filing.
Beijing E-Town Dragon Semiconductor Industry Investment Center is backed and operated by the city’s government.
“We are taking legal action to ensure our intellectual property rights are protected,” Applied Materials said in a statement, adding that it “vigorously safeguards” its IP and declined to comment further because of the pending litigation.
The lawsuit, which hasn’t previously been reported, is proceeding as concerns grow about the extent to which China is willing to go in its goal of circumventing US sanctions and acquiring the capabilities to build a world-class chip industry."

"Citigroup's $400M Q2 Expense Spike: Result of Job Cuts and Reduced Trading Activity, Says CEO",2023-06-15T07:20:00.000000000+00:00,"At a Morgan Stanley conference, Citigroup Inc's
CEO Mark Mason said that recent job cuts at the firm would cost up to $400 million this quarter compared to the first three months of the year.
The cuts primarily affected the investment banking and trading divisions, resulting in severance costs for approximately 1,600 employees in the second quarter.
Mason mentioned that the firm had already set aside severance funds for around 5,000 employees affected by the job cuts this year. Despite the expenses, Citigroup says it remains committed to managing costs by reducing headcount when necessary.
In addition, Mason cautioned that trading revenue has declined by 20% in the current quarter due to the Congressional debate surrounding the debt ceiling, which negatively impacted client activity throughout most of the period.
Similarly, revenue from the investment-banking division dropped by approximately 25%, in-line with industry trends.
Mason attributed these declines to concerns over the debt ceiling, particularly during April and May, and stated that there has been no significant increase in volatility or activity in the early days of June.

Hayley also revealed that Mark bring a big bag of Maltesers on every date night they have. She said: ""They don't sell Maltesers in LA, so we've been struggling to keep up with our own tradition.""

"India not for the fainthearted, but worth it: Lightspeed’s Bejul Somaia after Sequoia’s exit",2023-06-15T07:16:00.000000000+00:00,"India’s potential remains “incredibly compelling” with its sizeable market, high-quality founders and one-way adoption of technology, Bejul Somaia, partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners, said in a note posted on Twitter. “The question is not whether there is potential, but how best to navigate this potential”.
In the lengthy message, Somaia elaborated on Lightspeed’s views on broader opportunities for entrepreneurship in India. His post comes in the backdrop of Sequoia Capital’s India partnership being spun off into an independent entity, now known as Peak XV Partners.

“In light of last week's announcement by Sequoia that its India affiliate will become an independent entity, there has been speculation around whether this development is a reflection of the venture opportunity in India. While I can't comment on their decision, I do want to share Lightspeed's views on the broader opportunity for innovation and entrepreneurship in India,” Somaia wrote.
Lightspeed Venture Partners, which has backed several unicorn startups in India, including Razorpay, Byju’s, ShareChat and Udaan, has invested $1.6 billion in the Indian startup ecosystem and holds assets worth around $3.4 billion. The venture capital firm has returned approximately $1 billion to its investors.

Hinting that a large number of private companies in India are overvalued and that governance at startups should improve, Somaia said, “The start-up and venture model is predicated on learning and adapting fast, navigating to high upside and understanding that the few companies that really succeed drive economies and humanity forward, and create enormous value. And those that don't succeed contribute to a cycle of creative destruction that is essential to the development of an innovation economy.”
“India is not for the faint hearted. India is tough. But India is worth it,” he added.
Somaia added that at Lightspeed, the belief is that “India's importance as the world's third largest digital market should not be under-estimated, that significant value will be created in the transition to a digital economy, and that a new generation of founders will be central actors in this value creation”.
In his post, the investor also questioned whether there were 102 unicorns in India. His comments come at a time when the macroeconomic slowdown has led to a slump in funding for late- and growth-stage startups globally.

VW Tayron Seven-Seat SUV Confirmed To Go Global For Second Generation,2023-06-15T07:15:46.000000000+00:00,"In November 2020, Automotive News Europe reported about Volkswagen's plans to sell the Tayron outside of China as a replacement for the three-row Tiguan. Fast forward to April 2023, Autocar India wrote a similar story about the SUV's global expansion. Both publications were correct as VW has officially announced the nameplate will not be reserved for the People's Republic for much longer. It's coming to sit below the recently facelifted Touareg.
Speaking with Autocar UK, the man in charge of engineering mid and large models confirmed the Tayron will be launched internationally. However, it won't be the current model that has been around since late 2018 as the plan is to introduce the second generation to other markets. Karl-Heinz Hell said: ""We will extend our existing SUV lineup on a global basis with the second-generation Tayron, which is already under development and will go on sale by the middle of the decade.""
2024 Volkswagen Tiguan teasers
39 Photos
While the existing vehicle is assembled by the FAW-VW joint venture in China at the factory in Tianjin, the global Tayron is going to be manufactured at home in Germany at the Wolfsburg plant. Karl-Heinz Hell mentioned it's going to be bigger to reflect the size increase of the upcoming 2024 Tiguan. It'll ride on the same MQB Evo platform as the third-generation Tiguan but bigger to accommodate a third row.
It too will be offered with two plug-in hybrid powertrains – one with 201 hp and the other with 268 hp – thus mirroring the Tiguan. Similarly, it's going to support DC fast charging and provide an electric range of more than 62 miles (100 kilometers). Karl-Heinz Hell went on to say all engines have been developed from day one to meet the Euro 7 regulations programmed to come into effect in July 2025. These will send power to the front wheels or an optional 4Motion all-wheel-drive system.
Confusingly, VW plans to sell the Tayron as the Tiguan in the United States where there's also going to be a coupe-ified derivative with only five seats. In China, the model's first generation is known as the Tayron X and has been around for a little over three years.
Details about the design have not been released, but since it'll carry a different moniker, logic tells us VW intends to visually separate the Tayron from the regular Tiguan teased here. That would represent a departure from the current Tiguan and Tiguan Allspace as the latter is nothing more than a long-wheelbase version.
VW's crossover lineup has blossomed in Europe in recent years as aside from long-running nameplates such as the Touareg and Tiguan, the peeps from Wolfsburg also have the T-Roc, Taigo, T-Cross, and even a T-Roc Convertible. Of course, we mustn't omit the electric ID.4 and ID.5."

As part of that effort, it envisions 67% of new light vehicles sold nationwide to be electric by 2032. This figure would represent a tenfold increase on the current rate in less than nine years.
Since coming into office in 2021, President Biden’s administration has been characterised by efforts to accelerate automotive electrification. However, with industry lobby groups like the Alliance for Automotive Innovation—representing OEMs like General Motors, Toyota, and Volkswagen—calling the targets highly challenging because of ongoing supply chain issues, is this latest target a bridge too far?"
JPMorgan’s Asia Pacific ECM Head Murli Maiya Leaving the Bank,2023-06-15T07:02:00.000000000+00:00,"JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Asia Pacific equity capital markets head Murli Maiya is leaving the bank after 25 years.
The Hong Kong-based banker is pursuing an opportunity outside investment banking, according to an internal memo seen by Bloomberg News. Aloke Gupte and Alex Watkins, JPMorgan’s ECM co-heads for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, will expand their responsibilities to become co-heads of ECM International in addition to their existing roles.
Gupte and Watkins have jointly led EMEA ECM over the last three years, according to the memo from Asia Pacific Chief Executive Officer Filippo Gori and global ECM head Achintya Mangla. The ECM heads in the individual Asia Pacific markets will report to them, with local accountability to Gori.
A spokesperson for the bank confirmed the contents of the memo.
JPMorgan had reshuffled its ECM leadership in March, after naming Mangla sole head of global ECM last year.
Mangla said in an interview his firm had “a deep conviction in Asian ECM for the next 3-5 years so we will allocate our best resources towards that goal.”
Maiya’s tenure at the US lender included roles such as running Asia Pacific investment banking and financial institutions coverage and debt capital markets businesses, the memo showed. He had also been the bank’s CEO for south and southeast Asia.
The volume of initial public offerings has been subdued globally after aggressive interest rate hikes last year, high volatility and concerns around inflation sapped investors’ risk appetite and forced issuers to stay on the sidelines.
IPOs and secondary offerings have fetched $209 billion worldwide this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s a 4.7% decline from a year ago and a 68% decrease from this time in 2021, a record year for activity, the data show.
Mangla said he expected activity to pick up over the coming 3-5 years.
“These are market cycles, at some point the market cycles will change and the countries in Asia will grow significantly,” he added, pointing to the correlation between economic growth and capital market activity.

'Black Mirror' Season 6 takes another cheeky shot at HBO in 'Joan Is Awful',2023-06-15T07:01:00.000000000+00:00,"Black Mirror Season 6 is here at long last, and there's a lot of hidden elements to unpack — including the return of a long-running Black Mirror joke about HBO.
Episode 1, ""Joan Is Awful"", a very meta (even by Black Mirror standards) story about a woman whose life is dramatised on a streaming website in almost real time, has plenty of Easter eggs to break down just on its own — and hidden among the episode's big twists and the exploration of AI in relation to creativity is a dig at one of Netflix's rival streaming services.
And it's all thanks to the return of Black Mirror's ever-present fake TV show, Sea of Tranquility.
What's the HBO reference in ""Joan Is Awful""?
Before Joan (Annie Murphy) is plunged into her own meta-nightmare in ""Joan Is Awful"", there's a moment when she and her fiancé Krish (Avi Nash) are scrolling through ""Streamberry"" (the episode's fictional version of Netflix) to find something to watch.
SEE ALSO: Every 'Black Mirror' episode ever, ranked by overall dread
Krish suggests the show Sea of Tranquility, and the following description appears onscreen:
""HBO's seminal sci-fi western returns for a climactic tenth series. Follow our intrepid crew as they manifest destiny far beyond safety of the Inner Worlds.""
Joan's response? ""Eric said it blows.""
Ouch.
This isn't just a one-off cheeky jab, though — Sea of Tranquility has actually been popping up in Black Mirror for years.

The apparent popularity of the fake series is made clearer in the Season 3 episode ""Nosedive"", when protagonist Lacie (Bryce Dallas Howard) hitches a ride to ""Tranquility Con"" with a group of the show's obsessive fans. Meanwhile, news updates in the Season 5 episodes ""Smithereens"" and ""Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too"" allude to a Sea of Tranquility reboot.
And of course, there's also another reference to the show in Season 6, in episode 4, ""Mazey Day."" Paparazza Bo (Zazie Beetz) takes non-consensual photos of former Sea of Tranquility actor Justin Camley and his lover, an action which ends in tragedy.
Is this reference to a ""climactic tenth series"" the last we'll hear of Sea of Tranquility? Given how much Black Mirror co-creator Charlie Brooker enjoys in-jokes, we're going to guess no.

Mr Simoes will take up the post on January 1, with Sir Nigel remaining as chief executive until then and working on a smooth handover.
L&G said the appointment follows a “rigorous, global” hunt for a successor after Sir Nigel announced his plans to retire in January this year, having headed up the group since 2012.
Sir John Kingman, chairman of L&G, said: “Antonio brings a formidable leadership track record at the most senior level of financial services, working across complex, global organisations.

In his current role, Mr Simoes heads up Spanish bank Santander’s businesses in the UK, Spain, Portugal and Poland, working across retail and commercial banking, corporate and investment banking, wealth management and insurance.
He has held the post since September 2020.
Before joining Santander, he worked at HSBC for 13 years, including as chief executive of UK and Europe and latterly chief executive of global private banking.
He is a former McKinsey & Company partner.
Mr Simoes said he is taking over at L&G for an “important next chapter”.
He said: “This is a critical time for our industry, clients and customers, with emerging technologies, changing societal dynamics and wider economic forces presenting new challenges and opportunities that require all of us to adapt and evolve.”
Mr Simoes will be paid a salary of £1.2 million in his role at L&G and the group said his first pay review will take place in 2025.
He will be eligible for an annual bonus up to a potential £2.4 million and long-term incentive share awards worth a maximum £3.5 million each year, depending on performance.

Set up in 1836, it is valued on the stock market at around £15.6 billion."

Rumor: Kia Stinger To Return As 600-HP Halo Model,2023-06-15T07:00:00.000000000+00:00,"The Kia Stinger may return as an all-electric vehicle, according to an exclusive report in a South Korean publication. Per etnews, Hyundai has finalized the specifications of its next-generation drivetrains and batteries, which will likely be used in the 30-plus EVs the group will introduce by 2030.
The report doesn’t name the Stinger specifically, but there is mention of a model internally referred to as the Kia GT1, due to be launched in 2025. Its platform designation is eM, which suggests a slightly larger version of the E-GMP scalable platform currently used to underpin the Kia EV6 and Hyundai Ioniq 5.
The battery capacity is said to be 113.2 kWh, and performance will depend on the chosen dual-motor setup. GT1 will apparently be available with a 160 kW motor front and rear or a 200 kW motor in the front and a 250 kW unit on the rear axle. That’s a combined output of 430 horsepower in the lesser model and 603 hp in the top dog."
BMG Resources swells WA lithium-gold portfolio,2023-06-15T07:00:00.000000000+00:00,"BMG Resources has expanded its portfolio of Western Australian gold and lithium projects, acquiring the Bullabulling project in the Eastern Goldfields' emerging Coolgardie lithium and gold region. The company exercised its option on the project after initial reverse-circulation drilling confirmed strong prospectivity for lithium and gold. Plans for follow-up drilling is underway and more assays are due in the coming weeks.
BMG Resources has expanded its portfolio of Western Australian gold and lithium projects, acquiring the Bullabulling project in the Eastern Goldfields' emerging Coolgardie lithium and gold region.
The company exercised its option to acquire the project following what it says was a highly-encouraging maiden reverse-circulation (RC) drilling program.
Initial RC drill assays returned anomalous lithium and gold intercepts, confirming strong prospectivity for lithium and gold across the 185-square-kilometre project area, which lies immediately adjacent to and along strike from the multi-million-ounce Bullabulling gold mine.
At Bullabulling ’s Poolmans prospect, BMG returned a significant result of 4m grading 2.37 grams per tonne of gold from 53m deep. The result coincided with a quartz vein estimated at just over 1m in true width, implying a grade in the vein of greater than 8g/t gold.
BMG now hopes to delineate the vein along its near-surface extents in follow-up drilling. Management says local prospectors anecdotally corroborate government records that show Poolmans was a high-grade mine before being closed due to water ingress and a lack of manpower during war-time.
The company’s other priority assay results come from its Ubini prospect, including 3m grading 0.31 per cent lithium oxide from 12m and 4m grading 0.16 per cent lithium oxide from 13m, pointing to early potential for the discovery of significant lithium-bearing pegmatites.
BMG’s drilling builds on historic exploration at the site that identified widespread lithium-caesium-tantalum (LCT) pegmatites, several of them containing lithium mineralisation assaying greater than 1 per cent lithium oxide.
Prior to the maiden RC campaign, other work by BMG confirmed the LCT characteristics of the pegmatites through geochemical assay ratio analysis. Management also underlined the exploration potential of the system for economically significant lithium mineralisation by citing the presence of evolved mineral phases such as tantalite, cassiterite, amblygonite, zinnwaldite, lepidolite and spodumene, coupled with favourable textures.
BMG Resources’ managing director Bruce McCracken said: “BMG is delighted to bring the Bullabulling Project into our portfolio of Western Australian gold and lithium projects and secure a foothold in the emerging Coolgardie lithium and gold region. This highly prospective lithium and gold project presents a robust investment case for BMG, and an outstanding opportunity to generate shareholder value through early-stage exploration. The Coolgardie region boasts a long history of mining where the ground is well understood. Bullabulling is located close to infrastructure and major discoveries, including Mt Marion to the east and Nepean and West Spargoville to the south.”
The rest of the company’s RC assays are due back from the lab in the coming weeks and will help inform its next round of drilling to further test the strike extent of the anomalous LCT pegmatites, in addition to other priority targets.
BMG expects the acquisition of the project and its holding vehicle, Fairplay Gold, to be finalised in coming weeks with a cash payment of $200,000 and 15 million of its fully-paid ordinary shares."

Siemens Healthineers' Cardiac Surgery Robot Gets Marketing Approval in China,2023-06-15T07:00:00.000000000+00:00,"Siemens Healthineers' Cardiac Surgery Robot Gets Marketing Approval in China
(Yicai Global) June 15 -- Despite Siemens Healthineers saying last month that it would suspend the use of CorPath GRX, the cardiac surgery robot gained marketing approval in China.
The National Medical Product Administration announced this month that it gave the okay for Siemens Healthineers' CorPath GRX to be marketed in China. The regulator also noted that it will tighten the product's post-marketing supervision to protect patients' safety.
Siemens Healthineers said last month that it had suspended the application of CorPath GRX in cardiac surgery as it did not meet expectations. The firm's Chinese branch explained that the move was a strategic adjustment based on the feedback from global sales, not because of any concerns about the product's safety, effectiveness, and supervision.
CorPath GRX is the first surgical robot to enter the innovation green channel, a fast-track approval process introduced by the regulator in 2016 to speed up the entry of innovative medical devices into the market, The Paper reported, citing Siemens Healthineers China.
""We have cooperated with the NMPA and accepted strict technical audits, inspection, and testing to fully verify the safety and effectiveness of the product despite a long review time,"" Siemens Healthineers China added.
CorPath GRX system is the world's first robotic-assisted platform for endovascular surgery, developed by Corindus Vascular Robotics, a US medical robot company that was acquired by Siemens Healthineers for USD1.1 billion in 2019. Since then, it has been addressed as the vascular robotics division of Siemens Healthineers.
As of the third quarter of 2018, some 45 CorPath GRX were installed worldwide, over 95 percent of which in the United States. In the second quarter of 2019, eight more units were installed. But since Siemens Healthineers' acquisition of Corindus, the sales figure of the device were barely mentioned in earnings reports.
Corindus has a slow operation, few adaptation methods and compatible consumables, and high prices, The Paper cited industry insiders as saying.

Vodafone and Three are merging their UK operations,2023-06-15T07:00:00.000000000+00:00,"The companies said the merged company will be better equipped to handle rolling out 5G, though the deal may face issues with regulators.
Vodafone and Three have entered binding agreements to combine their UK operations, which will lead to the creation of the biggest mobile operator in the country.
The combined business will have more than 27m subscribers, pushing it past BT’s EE and Virgin Media’s O2. Vodafone will own 51pc of the new business, while Three will own the remaining 49pc.
No cash is being paid as part of the merger deal, which is expected to close before the end of 2024 if regulators and shareholders approve.
The new company plans to invest £11bn over a 10 year period to accelerate the roll-out of 5G across the UK. This was one of the main goals of the merger when it was first announced last year, with Vodafone claiming a merged company would be better equipped to handle the costs of a 5G roll-out.
The two companies also said the deal will benefit customers by improving the coverage and reliability of their combined network. Vodafone Group CEO Margherita Della Valle said the deal will be “great for customers, great for the country and great for competition”.
“For Vodafone, this transaction is a game changer in our home market,” Della Valle said. “This is a vote of confidence in the UK and its ambitions to be a centre for future technology.”
Last month, Vodafone revealed plans to cut 11,000 jobs globally over the next three years, as the company reported a performance slowdown. Della Valle said the company’s performance had “not been good enough” and that her priorities for the company are “customers, simplicity and growth”.
Under the current deal, the current Vodafone UK CEO Ahmed Essam will become the merged company’s CEO, while Three UK CFO Darren Purkis will take the role as CFO for the new company.
Regulatory hurdles
While the two companies have agreed on the merger, the deal still faces threat of being blocked by regulators in the UK.
Last year, Kester Mann, consumer and connectivity director at market research firm CCS Insight, said regulation would be a “major hurdle” if any deal begins to materialise.
UK telecoms regulator Ofcom has previously been outspoken against major mergers in this sector, blocking Three UK’s attempted £10.5bn takeover of 02 in 2016.
But in February 2022, the regulator made a statement that appeared to soften its stance on mergers, giving rise to the possibility that other competitors could combine their businesses in future.

Since the 61-year-old's resignation, This Morning has been plagued with allegations of ""toxicity"". Yesterday, ITV boss Dame Carolyn said: ""It deeply disappoints me but we do not recognise that at This Morning, we have tangible evidence to tell you where the vast majority of people at daytime at This Morning are extremely engaged and very motivated.""

She later added: ""When you use those words about our culture, we don't recognise that at our culture, it doesn't mean we don't take it seriously."" Dame Carolyn pushed back strongly against allegations that Schofield's affair was an open secret at ITV as people including Piers Morgan, James Haskell and Kevin Maguire had suggested, the session heard.
Dame Carolyn said ""we were repeatedly told nothing was happening"", and both men denied it ""both formally and informally"", with the younger employee, referred to as Person X, being questioned 12 times. ""There was only hearsay and rumour and speculation... Nobody on the board would have turned a blind eye to something as serious as this,"" she said.
It comes after Schofield, 61, resigned from ITV and was dropped by his talent agency YMU after admitting to an ""unwise but not illegal"" affair with a younger male colleague on the show. Dame Carolyn confirmed Schofield is ""receiving counselling"" since his exit and she is ""very concerned"" about his welfare."
"USDT Selling on Curve, Uniswap Spooks Traders Amid Bitcoin Drop",2023-06-15T06:58:00.000000000+00:00,"Millions worth of tether (USDT) stablecoins appeared to be selling off on popular Uniswap and Curve pools Thursday morning, sparking early signs of concern among traders.
USDT balances on Curve’s popular 3pool, a stablecoin swapping pool made up of USDT, USDC, and DAI, rose to over 72% early on Thursday – suggesting traders had exchanged tens of millions of USDT in favor of stablecoins USD coin (USDC) and dai (DAI).

— PeckShieldAlert (@PeckShieldAlert) June 15, 2023
Curve’s 3pool now holds over $300 million of USDT and nearly $55 million each of dai and usdc.
The imbalance suggests an increased preference for DAI and USDC over tether. Such sentiment was previously observed during Terra’s implosion last May and the collapse of crypto exchange FTX in November, as CoinDesk previously reported.
Tether CTO Paolo Arduino suggested in a tweet that some traders could be looking to “capitalize on the general sentiment” in the broader crypto markets, which has dipped in the past 24 hours.

A new era of ChatGPT could be ushered in by Nvidia’s supercomputer,2023-06-15T06:55:57.000000000+00:00,"Nvidia has announced a revolutionary supercomputer, the DGX GH200, which delivers almost 500 times more memory and 1 exaflop of performance compared to current systems. This has attracted interest from leading tech companies Google, Meta, and Microsoft, who aim to revolutionize generative AI, recommender systems, and data processing on an unprecedented scale. This will likely bring improvements to language models like GPT, potentially changing the world for regular users.
One of the key features of Nvidia’s DGX GH200 is that it provides 144 terabytes of shared memory- nearly 500 times more memory than a single Nvidia DGX A100 system. To fully understand how impressive this is, one needs to use terms such as “exaflop,” which is equivalent to a quintillion floating-point operations per second (FLOPs). This is a stark contrast to the 100 teraflops (TFLOPs) achieved by Nvidia’s RTX 4090 when overclocked which equals to one trillion floating-point operations per second (TFLOP).
The computer is powered by Nvidia’s GH200 Grace Hopper superchips and doesn’t require a PCIe connection between the CPU and GPU. The chipsets can work together seamlessly using the NVLink interconnect technology, which allows them to integrate a significant number of high-performance GPUs that are unsuitable for consumer PCs with ARM-based Nvidia Grace CPUs and H100 Tensor Core GPUs. This technology has enabled an impressive leap from eight to 256 chips paving the way for Nvidia’s Helios Supercomputer. Nvidia expects the Helios Supercomputer to be online by the end of the year and will encompass four DGX GH200 systems interconnected with Nvidia’s Quantum-2 InfiniBand.
To share the development of the DGX GH200 with the world, Nvidia has partnered with leading tech companies to explore generative AI workloads. It’s believed that the computational power provided by a single DGX GH200 system is well-suited to advance the training of sophisticated language models. This means that we can expect more powerful AI models, leading to more detailed and accurate text and a wider range of data for training. This could improve cultural understanding, context, coherence, and enable specialized AI chatbots that could replace human labor in specific technology fields. However, this could lead to potential job displacement. Nonetheless, Nvidia’s DGX GH200 will undoubtedly shake things up in the world of AI, furthering Nvidia’s lead over AMD.

Siemens to invest US$2.2 billion to ramp up global production; plans new plant in Singapore,2023-06-15T06:54:15.000000000+00:00,"ZURICH: Siemens will spend €2 billion (US$2.16 billion) on a new global investment plan, the German engineering and technology group said on Thursday (Jun 15), as it gears up to meet increased demand triggered by global stimulus packages.
Siemens will build new factories, research and development centres and training sites around the world, the company said in a statement, as it aims to tackle problems exposed by the COVID pandemic and rising geopolitical tensions.

As part of the investment programme, which will cover announcements made during 2023, Siemens will spend €200 million on a new plant for its industrial automation division in Singapore.
""Siemens is experiencing significantly above-market growth. Today we announce an investment strategy to boost future growth, drive innovation and increase resilience,"" said Siemens Chief Executive Roland Busch in a statement.
Siemens will also increase its research and development spending by €500 million this year, the company said on Thursday.

The company, which employs 311,000, is seen as a bellwether for the health of the global industrial economy. In 2022 it increased its annual sales by 16 per cent to €72 billion.
""This wave of investments is supported by our record order backlog and reflects our confidence in the future,"" Busch later told an event in Singapore.

The company has previously said its expects its total addressable market for its products, which range from trains to industrial software, to expand by 7 per cent per year between 2022 to 2027.
The increase in market size, from around €500 billion at present to nearly €700 billion, will be partly driven by stimulus programmes like the United States' US$369 billion Inflation Reduction Act and the €245 billion support from the European Union's Green Deal Industrial Plan.
Siemens also wants to grow faster than rivals, which include Johnson Controls, Alstom, Schneider Electric and ABB, and increase market share, Chief Executive Busch told analysts last month.
The investment programme could also be a response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, which gummed up supply chains and made it more expensive to transport products and components.
The company has already announced expansion plans for sites in Germany and the Czech Republic earlier this year, as well as invested US$220 million in a new rolling stock factory in Lexington, United States.

Further investment in the United States and Europe are also planned, the company said on Thursday."

Project plans to revamp Tampa Heights and the YMCA,2023-06-15T06:52:00.000000000+00:00,"HILLSBOROUGH COUNTY, Fla. — The YMCA is partnering with Ellison Development to revamp the Tampa Heights area with more housing, retail and a brand-new YMCA.
It's a plan with a $600 million price tag and still needs final approval.
If the city approves the project, it would bring some really big changes to the area.
Green space, offices, a hotel, and a brand-new YMCA are all part of the vision for Tampa Heights.
The YMCA has had a presence in Tampa for 135 years. CEO Matt Mitchell tells ABC Action News the nonprofit plays a big role in community needs and strives to evolve with the city around it.
“That’s what this project is all about. Evolving and growing so we can ensure our relevance for generations to come here in Tampa,” Mitchell said.
This project would bring a brand new 110,000-square-foot YMCA with a rooftop pool, a licensed preschool, more childcare options, and even pickleball courts.
The current standing YMCA will be knocked down and replaced with housing. Some of which will be considered affordable housing.
“We own a pretty valuable piece of land here. We don't want to sell it, so we're entering into a ground lease with developers,” Mitchell said.
That ground lease is with Ellison Development. Mitchell said it will actually go back to helping with the YMCA’s mission.
Mitchell said, “The Y will have annuity of the next 99 years. That money will help go to help fund programs and services throughout Tampa.”
Mitchell explained that the plan goes in front of the city council in the fall. If it's approved, they plan to get started on construction next summer.

Here is why Twitter is being sued for $250 million,2023-06-15T06:51:59.000000000+00:00,"Elon Musk's Twitter is being sued by National Music Publishers' Association (NMPA) over a massive copyright infringement.
San Francisco: The National Music Publishers’ Association (NMPA) in the US has sued Twitter for $250 million over a massive copyright infringement.
The lawsuit, filed in the federal court in the state of Tennessee on behalf of 17 music publishers, is seeking damages and injunctive relief for Twitter’s “wilful copyright infringement”.
“Twitter fuels its business with countless infringing copies of musical compositions, violating publishers’ and others’ exclusive rights under copyright law,” the lawsuit read.
“While numerous Twitter competitors recognise the need for proper licenses and agreements for the use of musical compositions on their platforms, Twitter does not, and instead breeds massive copyright infringement that harms music creators,” it added.
The lawsuit has a list of around 1,700 songs that has been included in multiple copyright notices to Twitter, asking the court to fine the micro-blogging platform up to $150,000 for each violation.
According to the lawsuit, the “pervasive infringing activity at issue in this case is no accident”.
While the Twitter platform began as a destination for short text-based messages, it widened its business model to compete more aggressively with other social media sites for users, advertisers, and subscribers.
“By design, the Twitter platform became a hot destination for multimedia content, with music-infused videos being of particular and paramount importance,” the lawsuit added.
The NMPA claimed that Twitter has failed to remove infringing content once notified and has “continued to assist known repeat infringers with their infringement” without risk of them losing their accounts.
Both the micro-blogging platform or Musk were yet to react to the lawsuit after being sued.
“Twitter profits handsomely from its infringement of Publishers’ repertoires of musical compositions. The audio and audio-visual recordings embodying those compositions attract and retain users (both account holders and visitors) and drive engagement, thereby furthering Twitter’s lucrative advertising business and other revenue streams,” read the lawsuit."
"TCS Cloud Study: AI Emerges As The Preferred Bet While Global C-Suite Sticking With Cloud, Despite Macro Headwinds",2023-06-15T06:48:00.000000000+00:00,"Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) latest survey of senior business leaders worldwide, ‘Connected Future: How Cloud Drives Business Innovation’ reveals that cloud remains a long-term investment priority for 70 percent of major corporations, despite current macro headwinds and the recent slowing of growth of global cloud providers, the company announced today through an exchange filing.
The global survey of 972 senior executives reveals that innovation is a major driver of cloud investment, with 59 percent reporting that cloud is crucial as a catalyst for innovation for their organization’s future.
This appears particularly true for artificial intelligence (AI) as 75 percent of respondents invested in AI and machine learning capabilities over the past two years, while 78 percent plan to do so over the coming 12-24 months. Both technologies are highly dependent on access to large amounts of data and scalability through cloud.
Women Quit TCS In Large Numbers As They Don't Want To Work From Office
Interestingly, more than a third of respondents (37 percent) have made progress in their goals for cloud-enabled innovation in the form of new business models, underlining the growing power of cloud to drive new revenue.
In addition, the study also finds a clear majority of respondents of 67 percent are using cloud technologies to achieve sustainability goals. However, 43 percent report difficulty in understanding the carbon footprints of cloud service providers. This suggests that while most respondents see cloud as an important and thus far successful part of their sustainability strategy, and increasingly use cloud tools to assess their own carbon impact, they are now demanding the same visibility from their cloud service providers.
Overall, despite significant progress in recent years, the study reveals that businesses still have a long way to go to unlock the full power and potential of cloud.
“This latest global study strongly affirms that there is no business strategy without a cloud strategy. A desire for greater efficiency, resilience, and flexibility drove early cloud adoption, and these remain critical factors. Businesses now more fully understand how cloud drives business growth and innovation for the long-term, and for most, the journey is only just getting started,"" said Krishnan Ramanujam, President, Enterprise Growth Group, TCS

Saudi firm RVCMC oversees largest auction of voluntary carbon credits yet,2023-06-15T06:46:00.000000000+00:00,"A Saudi company said it oversaw the sale of more than 2.2 million carbon offsets, in what it described as the largest auction of voluntary carbon credits held by anyone so far.
The credits were acquired by 16 Saudi and international companies. The biggest buyers were Aramco, Saudi Electricity Company and ENOWA (a subsidiary of NEOM), according to a statement made by Regional Voluntary Carbon Market Company, which hosted the auction in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi.
For the latest headlines, follow our Google News channel online or via the app.
The $2 billion carbon-credit market was rocked earlier this year by Zimbabwe’s plan to take half of all revenues generated from projects within its borders. That announcement and others like it have added uncertainty to the market as investors and a growing number of businesses turn to offsets to reduce their carbon footprints.
The basket of credits in the Nairobi auction includes 18 projects representing a mix of CO2 avoidance and removal, including projects such as improved clean cook stoves and renewable energy projects. Buyers who acquire the credits can use them to offset emissions connected to their business activity.
Three quarters of the carbon credits sold originated from countries in the Middle East, North Africa, and sub-Saharan Africa, includ-ing Kenya, Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda, Morocco, Egypt, and South Africa. The clearing price was 23.50 Saudi riyals (about $6.27) per carbon credit. One credit represents a ton of CO2.
In an interview ahead of the sale, RVCMC’s Chief Executive Officer Riham ElGizy said the company is now planning to set up an offsets exchange in the first half of next year in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. “Our ambition is being one of the largest markets in the world by 2030,” said ElGizy.
RVCMC hosted its first auction in Riyadh last October, which led to the sale of carbon credits representing 1.4 million tonnes of CO2, enough to compensate for the annual emissions of 250,000 family cars. The lead bidders were Aramco, Olayan Financing Company, and Saudi state-owned mining company Ma’aden. The total value of the credits sold at that auction wasn’t disclosed.
RVCMC was established by the Saudi Public Investment Fund and Saudi Tadawul Group Holding Company in October 2022. The PIF holds an 80 percent stake and Tadawul Group has a 20 percent shareholding in the company."

Many Twitter workers had their car windows smashed: Musk,2023-06-15T06:40:00.000000000+00:00,"San Francisco: Twitter-owner Elon Musk Thursday said that many Twitter workers feel insecure coming to work in downtown San Francisco and have had their car windows smashed.
Musk tweeted: “Many Twitter employees feel unsafe coming to work in downtown SF and have had their car windows smashed.”
“They also got such a null response from the police that they rarely even bother reporting crimes anymore, because nothing happens,” he wrote.
Several users expressed their thoughts on Musk’s post.
While one user said, “Elon, bring Twitter to Florida,” another commented, “Then why did you make everyone stop working remotely lol.”
On June 11, the tech billionaire shared an incident and said that one of his friends experienced a shooting in San Francisco.
In April this year, he had said that one could literally film a ‘Walking Dead’ episode unedited in downtown San Francisco.
Meanwhile, last month, he had posted, “So many stores shuttered in downtown SF. Feels post-apocalyptic.”
When one user asked “Didn’t you vote for Obama and Biden? Things didn’t turn to shit because of magic.”
“Yes, but they are not to blame for San Francisco. Fundamentally, states and cities must occasionally vote for the other party or you have a one party system. SF is what happens when one party has control for several decades — no feedback loop for correction, because they never lose, no matter how bad it gets,” Musk replied.

Twitter faces eviction from Boulder office after Elon Musk fails to pay landlord rent for three months straight,2023-06-15T06:37:00.000000000+00:00,"With a series of layoffs and unpaid bills, Twitter’s takeover by Elon Musk last year is going through a rocky patch. Reportedly, Twitter has not paid its Boulder landlord for the past three months. Now, as per court documents, a judge has directed the eviction of the employees from Twitter’s office. Back in 2022, Musk was frequently seen declaring his vision of expanding the scope of public discourse and expressing his willingness to buy Twitter in a $44 billion deal. Even then, Musk soon got cold feet and tried to kill the deal. However, after a row of legal processes, Elon Musk concluded the deal, and by October, the microblogging site belonged to him.
The landlord not being paid for months is unfortunate, but Twitter not being able to pay up for months implies that the platform’s operations are far from going well. According to reports, a Chicago-based landlord, Lot 2 SBO LLC, owns the 3401 Bluff St., Boulder, office of Twitter. The landlord was reportedly given a $968,000 letter of credit, from which it has been drawing to pay the rent. However, the details of this arrangement are not adequately presented. The issue arose when the money ran out in March. Since then, Twitter has not paid up.
After months of non-payment of rent, the Chicago-based landlord took this to court. Reports suggest that on May 31, 2023, the judge issued an order directing the sheriff to evict Twitter within the next 49 days, which means by the end of July. There was a time when there were about 300 employees who worked out of the Boulder office. Due to the layoffs, firings, and resignations, it is possible that the number is down to almost half now. The case is registered in Boulder District Court under the number 2023CV30342.
According to a report by TechCrunch, the publication received confirmation of the legal records, but the sheriff’s office has denied making any comment until the case is concluded. As per the report, this is not the only case of failure to pay. Twitter has another case to its name, reportedly filed by a cleaning company that is seeking $93,504. Twitter has not responded to the publication’s request for a comment.
Recently, Twitter has also refused to clear its Google Cloud bills. The contract signed between the two tech giants is nearing its renewal this month. According to Platformer, this refusal can pose a threat to the trust and safety of the platform. Prior to Musk’s takeover, the two companies signed a contract to take a stand against spam and to provide protection to the accounts on the platform, among other things.

Other information regarding how such a disruption will impact the security and safety of Twitter was missing, according to the platformer report. As per the report, Twitter has been attempting to renegotiate the terms of its agreement with Google since March. Additionally, according to reports, Amazon forwarded a warning to Twitter in the same month about withdrawing the advertising revenues due to Twitter’s unpaid fees to Amazon Web Services for using the cloud computing services."
Chinese Hackers Exploit VMware ESXi Zero-Day to Execute Privileged Commands,2023-06-15T06:35:50.000000000+00:00,"The Chinese cyberespionage gang, identified as UNC3886, has been spotted employing a VMware ESXi zero-day vulnerability to get escalated privileges on guest virtual machines.
UNC3886 has been using malicious vSphere Installation Bundles (VIBs), typically used to maintain systems and deploy updates, to install backdoors on ESXi hypervisors, and gain access to command execution, file manipulation, and reverse shell capabilities. This activity was first reported in September 2022.
The group’s malicious activities would affect Windows virtual machines (VM), vCenter servers, and VMware ESXi hosts.
UNC3886 VMware Zero-Day Attack
The gang has also used a zero-day vulnerability in VMware Tools to bypass authentication and run privileged commands on Windows, Linux, and PhotonOS (vCenter) guest VMs.
The vulnerability, CVE-2023-20867, has been given a “low severity” rating since it can only be exploited by an attacker with root access to the ESXi server.
“A fully compromised ESXi host can force VMware Tools to fail to authenticate host-to-guest operations, impacting the confidentiality and integrity of the guest virtual machine,” VMware said in its security advisory.
Mandiant claims that UNC3886 was seen employing scripts to enumerate all ESXi hosts and their guest VMs, change lists of allowed IPs across all connected ESXi hosts, and collect credentials from compromised vCenter servers using the associated vPostgreSQL database.
“Additionally, the use of CVE-2023-20867 does not generate an authentication log event on the guest VM when commands are executed from the ESXi host,” researchers said.
The cybersecurity company also saw the group installing two backdoors (VirtualPita and VirtualGate) that used VMCI sockets for persistence and lateral movement.
In addition to enabling network segmentation bypass and the evasion of security inspections for open listening ports, the malware gives the attackers a new degree of persistence (access to the infected ESXi host is recovered by accessing a VM).
“The attack is highly targeted, with some hints of preferred governmental or government-related targets,” Fortinet said.
“The exploit requires a deep understanding of FortiOS and the underlying hardware. Custom implants show that the actor has advanced capabilities, including reverse-engineering various parts of FortiOS.”
According to Mandiant, UNC3886’s usage of a wide variety of new malware families and harmful tools designed specifically for the platforms they are targeting implies significant research capabilities and an out-of-the-ordinary capacity to comprehend the sophisticated technology the use of the targeted appliance.
In assaults against organizations involved in defense, technology, and telecommunications in the US and the Asia-Pacific area, UNC3886 is renowned for using zero-day vulnerabilities in firewall and virtualization solutions.

If I’d invested £10k in dirt cheap Barclays shares three months ago here’s what I’d have now,2023-06-15T06:30:00.000000000+00:00,"I’m a fan of investing in FTSE 100 banks, but even I have to admit Barclays (LSE: BARC) shares have generated little excitement lately.
They almost went into meltdown in February, as markets decided Barclays was more vulnerable to the banking crisis than London-listed peers Lloyds Banking Group or NatWest.
It’s been slow going
That’s because Barclays has retained a US investment banking operation, while Lloyds and NatWest ditched theirs. It’s the riskiest of the three but, potentially, the most rewarding too.
The banking crisis threw up a short-lived buying opportunity in Barclays. Over the last three months, its share price has rallied 13.4%. That’s hardly thunderous growth, but better than nothing. If I’d invested £10,000 on 14 March, I’d have £11,340 today.
It’s always nice when a new stock purchase starts well, although I’d never measure success over such a ridiculously short timeframe. My ideal holding period runs into decades.
Long-term investing is particularly important when buying a stock like Barclays, which is out of favour with the market and needs time and patience to recover. Its share price has fallen 20.78% over five years and is up just 0.89% over 12 months.
It’s now trading at a rock-bottom valuation of just 5.1 times earnings, one of the lowest on the FTSE 100. Its price-to-book ratio is just 0.4, where a figure of 1 is seen as fair value. This is ridiculously cheap, which is in its favour. On the other hand, Barclays has been cheap for so long I’m reluctant to flag this up as a buying opportunity.
The bank is nonetheless making money hand over fist, with group income jumping 11% to £7.2bn in Q1, delivering pre-tax profits of £2.6bn.
In full-year 2022, it made pretax profit of £7bn, which markets disliked because it was down from £8.2bn in 2021. That was largely due to £1.22bn credit impairment charges.
Barclays faces plenty of challenges as the global economy wilts. It has laid off investment banking staff amid an extended slowdown in its dealmaking and capital markets arms. Given the state of the housing market, debt impairments may now rise. The looming US recession has already forced it to push it up bad debt provisions to cover credit card defaults.
I still think it’s a good buy
On the other hand, further UK interest rate hikes will allow Barclays to widen its net interest margins, the difference between what it pays savers and charges borrowers.
All this suggests to me that when the global economy gets its mojo back, sentiment towards Barclays could swiftly rebound. While we wait, analysts are forecasting a dividend of 8.6p share in 2023, followed by 9.7p per share in 2024.
In March, my £10,000 stake would have bought me 6,579 shares at 152p each. This year, they would have paid me dividends totalling £566, with £638 to follow in 2024. That’s on top of the £1,340 share price growth I have enjoyed, so far. As ever, none of this is guaranteed.
If Barclays shares kick on and maintains its dividend, my total returns will rise over time, although, again, these things are never guaranteed. The dirt cheap bank was a good buy in March and I still think it’s a good buy today."

"Opposition MPs to raise former Twitter CEO's ""pressure"" remark in parliamentary panel meeting today",2023-06-15T06:30:00.000000000+00:00,"New Delhi [India], June 15 (ANI): Amid the political war over former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey's allegation that the Indian Government threatened to shut down the microblogging site's operation in India, the Opposition party MPs are set to raise the matter in the Parliamentary Standing Committee for Communication and Information Technology (IT) meeting on Thursday.
""We will raise the recent statement of the former CEO of Twitter Jack Dorsey's allegation in which the Government of India threatened to block Twitter during the farmer protests in the country. We would seek a response from the official attending the meeting today on behalf of the government,"" an opposition party MP told ANI.
The MP further said, ""Opposition MPs want the chairman to allow the issue concerned with Dorsey's ""pressure"" remark to be raised in the meeting and the government to respond to it.""
A parliamentary standing committee is scheduled to meet today under the chairmanship of Shiv Sena (Shinde faction) Lok Sabha MP Jadhav Prataprao Ganpatrao. The parliamentary panel has been called to discuss citizen data security and privacy.
""Evidence of the representatives of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology on the subject 'Citizens' data security and privacy"", Committee agenda read.
The committee has total of 31 members from different parties including both houses (Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha).
Earlier, the former Twitter CEO in an interview aired on the YouTube channel alleged that the Indian government threatened to shut down the microblogging portal.
""India is one of the countries which had many requests around farmers' protests, around particular journalists who were critical of the government and it manifested in ways such as we will shut Twitter down in India, India is a big marketplace for us. We would raid the homes of your employees, which they did and we will shut down your offices if you don't follow suit and this is India, a democratic country,"" Dorsey said in the interview.
Meanwhile, on Tuesday, Union Minister of State for Electronics and Information Technology Rajeev Chandrasekhar hit out at Jack Dorsey's Indian government's ""pressure"" remark. Chandrasekhar alleged that between 2020 and 2022, Twitter was found violating Indian law multiple times and the platform had started to comply with the law only in 2022.
Reacting to Dorsey's claim, Rajeev Chandrasekhar called it ""an outright lie"" and ""an attempt to brush out the very dubious period"" of the social media company's history. He said that Twitter ""weaponised misinformation"" against Indians and the government of India during the period of 2020.
Speaking to ANI, Chandrasekhar said, ""During the period of 2020, Twitter weaponised misinformation against Indians and the government of India and therefore they were exposed. Twitter which is now in the public domain, during this period, was not only partisan but was behaving in an absolutely arbitrary manner and the Twitter files that have then come out after Jack Dorsey sold Twitter exposed it to be a platform that abused its power, misused its power.""
""Between 2020-2022, Twitter violated Indian law multiple times. It started complying with the law only in 2022. During that entire period, nobody went to jail, and nobody was raided. Jack Dorsey knowing very well that Twitter did not comply with any law and didn't face any consequence, is today lying and making stories about raids and arrests,"" Chandrasekhar said. (ANI)"
"We will always look for integration and interoperability when it comes to AI offerings: Praval Singh, Zoho",2023-06-15T06:29:23.000000000+00:00,"Zoho Corporation, an Indian multinational technology company founded by Sridhar Vembu, has announced that after establishing its presence in the SMB segment, the company has achieved a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 65% in ARR within the mid-market and enterprise segments over the past three years. During an event held in New Delhi, the company revealed that it now serves over 90 million users across more than 600,000 businesses.
Praval Singh, Vice President of Marketing and Customer Experience at Zoho, attributed the growth in the UpMarket segment to the company’s commitment to “Make in India.” He stated, “We have over 55 apps across every business category, and we gain the trust of organizations with one offering at a time. We never say we will replace their entire technology stack. We begin with one offering and then expand as we gain trust from the enterprises.”
Zoho’s expansion in the Indian market has seen significant growth in sectors such as banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI), manufacturing, retail, fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), pharmaceuticals, and IT. Some of the company’s customers include MakeMyTrip, PUMA, Axis Finance, Paper Boat, Samsonite, BigBasket, Tata Play Fiber, BYJU’S, Star Health & Allied Insurance, Mercedes-Benz India, SpiceJet, IIFL Finance, Meril Life Sciences, Blue Star, Bosch, Zomato, Saint-Gobain, Deloitte, and McDonald’s, among others.
In addition to these clients, the company actively collaborates with state and central government departments, as well as public sector undertakings (PSUs), to support their digitalization initiatives. To strengthen its account management capabilities and cater to the specific requirements of large organizations, Zoho has expanded its workforce with customer-facing teams and established offices in key cities including Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, and Hyderabad.
Singh emphasized that Zoho’s ability to integrate and interoperate with the existing technology stacks of larger enterprises is one of their unique selling points, contributing to their popularity in the segment. He mentioned that Zoho also offers shorter implementation times and affordability compared to several competitors.
Will Zoho Launch its Own Generative AI Offering?
Regarding the launch of Zoho’s own proprietary generative AI offering, while the company has announced a tie-up with OpenAI for ChatGPT integration, it may take some time before their own Generative AI offering is launched. Singh stated that while Zoho has been working in the AI domain for the past ten years, with Vembu overseeing the development, they remain open to integrating and interoperating with other existing players. He commented, “It is never going to be an either/or as far as our offerings are concerned.”"

SONO - Sonos Announces Layoffs: Is the Beaten-Down Stock a Buy?,2023-06-15T06:25:00.000000000+00:00,"2023-06-15 06:25:00 ET
Expensive home audio equipment isn't exactly recession-proof. Sonos (NASDAQ: SONO) , known for its pricey wireless speakers and soundbars, is facing a rough downturn as consumers pull back on spending.
Revenue tumbled 23.9% year over year in the fiscal second quarter, which ended April 1, and free cash flow sank deep into negative territory on rising inventories. An inventory overhang among channel partners, coupled with weak consumer demand, has Sonos predicting a revenue decline between 4% and 7% for the full year.
Against this tough backdrop, Sonos announced on Wednesday that it would be laying off 7% of its workforce. In addition to the layoffs, the company is working to reduce its real estate footprint and rethinking some of its spending. Sonos will take between $11 million and $14 million in charges related to these moves.

Legal & General Names Antonio Simoes as Chief Executive Officer,2023-06-15T06:19:00.000000000+00:00,"Legal & General Group Plc said António Simões will replace Nigel Wilson as its chief executive officer.
Simões, who joins from Banco Santander where he was Regional Head of Europe, will take up the role on Jan. 1, according to a statement Thursday. The former McKinsey & Co. partner spent 13 years at HSBC, including as CEO of UK and Europe, before joining Santander.
Nigel Wilson said in January he was stepping down as CEO after more than a decade at the helm of the financial services group. Over his tenure he oversaw the growth of Legal & General Investment Management into one of Europe’s largest, with more than £1.3 trillion ($1.6 trillion) under management.
Wilson also established Legal & General Capital, the group’s alternative asset platform, in 2013. The platform has enabled investments in infrastructure and housing projects across the UK."
Will Tom Brady play for the Raiders? Maxx Crosby 'would not be surprised' with NFL GOAT's return in Las Vegas,2023-06-15T06:18:00.000000000+00:00,"Maxx Crosby is among those who believe Tom Brady will return to the NFL with the Las Vegas Raiders.
Even though the new Raiders part-owner has insisted that he is permanently retired from the league, there are still rumors of him returning to the field, especially with Jimmy Garoppolo reportedly being slow to recuperate from his foot injury.
Count Maxx Crosby among the believers in said rumors. In an appearance on Von Miller's The Voncast, the two-time Pro Bowl defensive end said:
""The possibility, honestly, you know, obviously we got Jimmy G. He's coming back he's gonna be healthy. But you know, you never know what's gonna happen. Tom Brady's a competitor, the greatest of all time.
""So, you know, at the absolute worst, you know if everything doesn't go the way it's supposed to, and we need him, I would not be surprised if Tom Brady shows up in a Raiders jersey.""
What else did Maxx Crosby say about his teammates to Von Miller?
The episode with Maxx Crosby was The Voncast's first in almost two months, and he had plenty to talk about with host Von Miller - from headbutting Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes on Monday Night Football to the ending of the Raiders' 2022 game against the New England Patriots.
The Raiders defensive end also discussed the his team's current roster, particularly their pass rushing unit that includes himself, Chandler Jones, and rookie draft pick Tyree Wilson:
""Honestly, I really think we got a lot of work to do. I feel like the first year, there's a lot of growing pains, ups and downs... I'm like, Chandler Jones, one of my favorite guys, one of the most unorthodox rushers, and now we're teammates and he's bragging about me, which is honestly surreal... (He's) had an incredible offseason and I'm excited to have him, take a huge step forward this year, and Tyree's coming in...""
Speaking of Tyree Wilson, Maxx Crosby had this to say:
""He's a quiet kid. He's got all the ability in the world to do this - 6'5"", 275 (lbs), huge frame, a great athlete. It really comes down to putting in the work, and I see him doing that. He's doing that every day.
""As a rookie there's a lot of things going on... all the media stuff, all this going on. But he's been focused, and that's the main thing I take away from him, he's locked in."""

H&M upbeat on June after chilly weather hits quarterly sales,2023-06-15T06:15:00.000000000+00:00,"By Marie Mannes and Anna Ringstrom
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -H&M reported weaker than expected second quarter sales on Thursday as chilly weather held back demand in key markets, although the Swedish clothes group said June had started well and its shares rose by 3% in early trading.
Analysts polled by Reuters had on average forecast a year-on-year rise of 1% after H&M flagged in late March that cold weather was dampening demand for spring and summer styles.
""Sales in the second quarter were affected by unfavourable weather conditions compared to the corresponding period last year on several of the H&M group's large markets"" H&M said.
Jefferies said in a note to clients that the update was a little less downbeat than feared, but it was still a clear lag compared to competitors, with cold weather in northern Europe a drag as well as H&M's large U.S. presence.
Zara owner Inditex, whose largest market is warmer Spain, has a smaller share of sales in northern Europe and the U.S. and is also less affected by weather swings.
H&M said sales in June, the first month of its third quarter, had got off to a good start and Richard Chamberlain at Royal Bank of Canada said this period will be helped by warmer weather and a positive calendar impact.
Net sales at the world's second-biggest fashion retailer after were up 6% to 57.6 billion crowns ($5.36 billion) against a forecast 7% rise.
H&M launched a savings drive in 2022 after a spike in costs which it has only partly been passing on to cash-strapped customers, and its sales growth has been lagging that of Inditex as well as online rivals such as the fast-expanding Shein.
Inditex, which has coped better than H&M in sluggish markets, last week said net sales in its quarter through April were up 13% and, in May, up 16%.
H&M's unchanged local currency turnover is a slowdown from the previous quarter, as well as from 2022.
H&M, whose single-biggest market is Germany, is due to publish its full quarterly earnings report on June 29.

GGG - Graco Develops Electric Variable Ratio Metering for 2K Material,2023-06-15T06:15:00.000000000+00:00,"EVR™ Allows Manufacturers to Change Ratios Without Changing Equipment
Graco Inc. (NYSE:GGG) , a leading manufacturer of fluid handling equipment, introduces the Electric Variable Ratio Metering System . Now available for customization, the EVR™ allows manufacturers to change ratios as they mix, meter and dispense two component (2K) material – all with the same equipment.

“For many industrial manufacturers, honing certain material compositions means putting production on hold to swap out hardware or pumps,” said Robert Delgado, global strategist and product manager for eMobility in Graco’s Industrial Division. “This is especially problematic for electric vehicle (EV) battery assembly and other applications, with constantly changing process requirements and technical specifications.”
While developing EVR technology, Graco also worked with material suppliers about the need to try different ratios and viscosities for research and development purposes, for example, when design engineers write product specifications.
“Whether it’s thermal interface material, epoxy, silicone, urethane or acrylic; two component material uses and requirements are always changing,” said Delgado. “To keep up, manufacturers and suppliers must make adjustments ‘on the fly’ and with minimal capital reinvestment.”
The high flow EVR can move up to 6,400 cubic centimeters (ccs) per minute, while flexing dispense ratios anywhere between 1:1 to 5:1 or 2:1 to 10:1.
When it’s time to try different material, the EVR’s base purge feature conserves the amount of solvent used to clean out the system by independently driving either material side. It also keeps old material from curing, so that there’s no need to replace a static or dynamic mixer because of fast curing materials or intermittent production runs.

Google faces EU break-up order over anti-competitive adtech practices,2023-06-15T06:15:00.000000000+00:00,"Alphabet’s Google may have to sell part of its lucrative adtech business to address concerns about anti-competitive practices, EU regulators said on Wednesday, threatening the company with its harshest regulatory penalty to date.
The European Commission set out its charges in a statement of objections to Google two years after opening an investigation into behaviours such as favouring its own advertising services, which could also lead to a fine of as much as 10% of Google’s annual global turnover.
The stakes are higher for Google in this latest clash with regulators as it concerns the company’s biggest money maker, with the advertising business accounting for 79% of total revenue last year.
Its 2022 advertising revenue, including from search services, Gmail, Google Play, Google Maps, YouTube adverts, Google Ad Manager, AdMob and AdSense, amounted to $224.5 billion.

Google has a few months to respond to the charge. It can also ask for a closed hearing in front of senior Commission antitrust officials and their national counterparts before the EU issues a decision in a process that could take a year or more. The company also could potentially settle by offering stronger remedies than previously proposed.
EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said Google may have to sell part of its adtech business because a behavioural remedy is unlikely to be effective at stopping the anti-competitive practices.
“For instance, Google could divest its sell-side tools, DFP and AdX. By doing so, we would put an end to the conflicts of interest,” she told a news conference.
“Of course I know this is a strong statement but it is a reflection of the nature of the markets, how they function and also why a behavioural commitment seemed to be out of the question.”

Google said it disagreed with the Commission’s charge.
“The Commission’s investigation focuses on a narrow aspect of our advertising business and is not new. We disagree with the EC’s view,” Dan Taylor, Google’s vice president of global ads, said in a statement.

Vestager said investigations would continue into Google’s introduction of a privacy sandbox set of tools to block third party cookies on its Chrome browser and its plan to stop making the advertising identifier available to third parties on Android smartphones.
She said the EU had closely cooperated with competition authorities in the United States and the UK.
The European Publishers Council, which filed a complaint to the Commission last year, welcomed the charge.
The Commission said Google favours its own online display advertising technology services to the detriment of competing providers of advertising technology services, advertisers and online publishers.
It said Google has abused its dominance since 2014 by favouring its own ad exchange AdX in the ad selection auction by its dominant publisher ad server DFP, and also by favouring AdX in the way its ad buying tools Google Ads and DV360 place bids on ad exchanges.
Google is the world’s dominant digital advertising platform with a 28% market share of global ad revenue, according to research firm Insider Intelligence.

Google had sought to settle the case three months after the investigation was opened but regulators grew frustrated with the slow pace and the lack of substantial concessions, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters previously."
H&M Blames Weather for Flat Sales as It Lags Behind Zara,2023-06-15T06:12:00.000000000+00:00,"Hennes & Mauritz AB blamed poor weather for flat second-quarter revenue as the Swedish retailer keeps lagging competitor Zara in popularity among fast-fashion shoppers.
Unfavorable weather conditions including a cold March weighed on sales, H&M said, adding that June has got off to a good start. Revenue of 57.62 billion kronor ($5.4 billion) in the three months through May came short of analysts’ estimates.
The slowdown threatens to worsen an inventory buildup that has plagued the retailer for more than six years, and it casts doubt on Chief Executive Officer Helena Helmersson’s goal to double sales by 2030.
Inditex SA, the owner of the Zara chain, reported a 15% rise in revenue for the three months through April, and similar momentum so far this quarter.

Siemens to spend $2.2 billion to ramp up global production,2023-06-15T06:09:00.000000000+00:00,"By John Revill and Fanny Potkin
SINGAPORE/ZURICH (Reuters) -Siemens will spend 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion) on a new global investment plan, the German engineering group said on Thursday, to make its operations more resilient against supply chain disruptions and geopolitical tensions.
Siemens will build new factories, research and development centres and training sites around the world, the company said, as it also aims to take maximum benefit of stimulus packages in the United States and Europe.
Under the investment programme, which will cover announcements made during 2023, Siemens announced a new 200 million euros plant for its industrial automation division in Singapore.
""Siemens is experiencing significantly above-market growth. Today we announce an investment strategy to boost future growth, drive innovation and increase resilience,"" said Siemens Chief Executive Roland Busch.
Siemens will also increase its research and development spending by 500 million euros this year, the company said.
The company, seen as a bellwether for industrial demand, has seen rapid growth since the post-COVID restart, increasing its sales to 72 billion euros last year from 62 billion euros in 2021.
""This wave of investments is supported by our record order backlog and reflects our confidence in the future,"" Busch later told an event in Singapore.
FURTHER INVESTMENT IN EUROPE AND US
The company has previously said it expects its total addressable market for its products, which range from trains to industrial software, to expand by 7% per year between 2022 to 2027, although Busch wants to grow faster.
The expansion programme - which will see further investment in Europe and the United States - could be a response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, which gummed up supply chains and logistics.
Busch said a lesson learned from COVID times was that efforts to save money on supply chains ""made us over-dependent on certain countries""."
Siemens to invest $2.2 billion to ramp up global production,2023-06-15T06:09:00.000000000+00:00,"By John Revill
ZURICH (Reuters) -Siemens will spend 2 billion euros ($2.16 billion) on a new global investment plan, the German engineering and technology group said on Thursday, as it gears up to meet increased demand triggered by global stimulus packages.
Siemens will build new factories, research and development centres and training sites around the world, the company said in a statement, as it aims to tackle problems exposed by the COVID pandemic and rising geopolitical tensions.
As part of the investment programme, which will cover announcements made during 2023, Siemens will spend 200 million euros on a new plant for its industrial automation division in Singapore.
""Siemens is experiencing significantly above-market growth. Today we announce an investment strategy to boost future growth, drive innovation and increase resilience,"" said Siemens Chief Executive Roland Busch in a statement.
Siemens will also increase its research and development spending by 500 million euros this year, the company said on Thursday.
The company, which employs 311,000, is seen as a bellwether for the health of the global industrial economy. In 2022 it increased its annual sales by 16% to 72 billion euros.
""This wave of investments is supported by our record order backlog and reflects our confidence in the future,"" Busch later told an event in Singapore.
The company has previously said its expects its total addressable market for its products, which range from trains to industrial software, to expand by 7% per year between 2022 to 2027.
The increase will be partly driven by stimulus programmes, such ase the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States and Europe's Green Deal. Siemens also wants to grow faster than rivals and increase market share, Busch told analysts last month.
The investment programme - which will see further investment in Europe and the United States - could also be a response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, which gummed up supply chains and logistics.
Rising tensions between Beijing and Washington have made many companies wary of their dependence on China, especially with U.S. attempts to block China's access to the latest technology.
Busch had originally favoured China as a location for the Singapore project but he faced resistance from Siemens's supervisory board worried about the growing geopolitical tensions in the region, German business newspaper Wirtschaftswoche said earlier this week.
Still, on Thursday Siemens said it was also investing 140 million euros to expand its digital factory in the Chinese city of Chengdu and building a new R&D centre in Shenzhen."
"North Korean hackers create fake web portal, says South Korea's spy agency",2023-06-15T06:04:46.000000000+00:00,"SEOUL: North Korean hackers have set up a fake website that looks almost identical to the popular South Korean web portal Naver, marking a more sophisticated attempt to target users in the South, Seoul's spy agency said.
The National Intelligence Service (NIS) issued a warning this week, urging people to refrain from accessing the website called ""Naver Portal"" and said it was working with overseas organisations to track down the activity of the group it believed was behind the fake portal.

""North Korea's hacking attacks targeting South Koreans are getting more elaborate,"" the spy agency said in a statement on Wednesday (Jun 14).
Naver, which is operated by the tech giant of the same name, is South Korea's most-used web portal and search engine and offers various services ranging from email, news aggregation and online shopping.
The NIS did not say how many people may have been tricked by the portal or had disclosed personal information.
A Naver representative on Thursday said: ""We urge users to pay attention to the domain address when accessing Naver.""
North Korean hackers have been blamed for cyberattacks netting millions of dollars, though Pyongyang previously has denied being involved in cybercrime.

Earlier this year, the United Nations reported North Korea had stolen more cryptocurrency assets in 2022 than in any other year. International monitors say stolen money has been pumped into North Korea's sanctioned nuclear and missile programs.
More than 70 per cent of North Korean hacking attempts are via emails, most of them pretending to have been sent under the names of South Korean web portals such as Naver and Daum, the NIS said last month, describing them as ""social engineering"" attacks."

BofA earlier expected the terminal rate to be held at the current 5%-5.25% range, but the change in forecast comes after the Fed kept its key rate unchanged in the 5%-5.25% on Wednesday, but signaled two more hikes might be needed in 2023 to tame inflation.
The research firm said in a note late Wednesday that it now expects the Fed to increase rates in July and September, and also pushed out its rate-cut expectation to May 2024, from an earlier expectation of a cut in March."
Vodafone and Hutchison's UK mobile merger faces tough test yet,2023-06-15T06:04:00.000000000+00:00,"By Paul Sandle
LONDON (Reuters) -It has taken months of tortuous negotiations for Vodafone and CK Hutchison to agree a deal to create Britain's biggest mobile operator, but from a regulatory standpoint the hard work is only just beginning.
The $19 billion tie-up will be scrutinised by Britain's Competition and Markets Authority, the antitrust regulator which made global headlines in April when it blocked Microsoft's $69 billion acquisition of ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard.
The long-awaited mobile deal reduces the number of networks from four to three, challenging a tenet long held by regulators that four help to keep prices low in major markets.
Hutchison tried to buy Telefonica's O2 network seven years ago, but the deal - already opposed by Britain's telecoms regulator Ofcom - was blocked by the European Commission on the grounds that it would damage competition. Legal wrangling about that decision continues.
Any UK ruling is likely to take well over a year.
Analyst Paolo Pescatore at PP Foresight said the tie-up will be a hard sale given that both Vodafone and Hutchison's Three UK have been outperforming the market for the last year or so.
""Both parties need to demonstrate that this is genuinely in the interest of UK plc, the economy, and consumers for it to have a chance of getting over the line,"" he said.
Aware of the hurdle ahead, Vodafone and Hong Kong-based Hutchison put the emphasis on an 11 billion-pound 5G plan they pledged to deliver over 10 years for Britain, rather than more profit for shareholders.
Customers will be no worse in terms of bills and will be better in terms of network performance, they said.
Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, said securing regulatory approval could be ""a tall order given the likely concerns over diminished competition and consumer choice"".
Peter Broadhurst, a partner in the antitrust and competition group at Crowell & Moring, said the CMA had become more interventionist in the last three years. However, he thought it would look for remedies to approve the deal."
Hyundai Exter micro-SUV interior pictures leaked – To get cruise control and digital instrument cluster,2023-06-15T06:02:25.000000000+00:00,"The Indian subsidiary of South Korean automotive giant Hyundai, Hyundai Motor India, is set to disrupt the micro-SUV segment with the launch of its newest model, the Exter, which has been unveiled in the country. The company has showcased the exterior design of this micro-SUV and has also revealed its powertrain details. However, until recently, information about its interior was kept well-guarded. But, as expected, the internet has managed to find out what the interior of the forthcoming Exter will look like. The latest spy pictures of the Hyundai Exter reveal its interior design.
Carwale has shared a side shot of the interior of the upcoming Hyundai Exter, and from the picture, we can note that the micro-SUV will feature a dashboard layout that seems to be a hybrid of the Hyundai i20 and Kia Sonet, with a few unique details of its own. Firstly, the infotainment screen and the fully digital dashboard will be integrated into a single unit. The buttons for the infotainment system will be placed on both sides of the screen. Additionally, rectangular center air conditioning vents will be positioned below the screen. Although the picture does not show the air conditioning controls, we know that they will be present there.
Further observations of the interior spy pics reveal that the Exter will have the exact steering wheel from the previous generation of the Hyundai Venue sub-compact SUV. The steering wheel will include the usual volume and radio controls. The pictures also reveal that the car will be equipped with a cruise control system, and the controls for it will be on the right side of the steering wheel. Apart from this, as mentioned earlier, the Exter will have a fully digital instrument cluster and will offer multiple Indian language options as well.

The forthcoming Exter will be offered in 13 petrol variants. The list of these variants includes EX MT, S MT, S(O) MT, S AMT, SX MT, SX Dual Tone MT, SX AMT, SX Dual Tone AMT, SX(O), SX(O) AMT, SX(O) Connect, and SX(O) Connect AMT. Meanwhile, there will be 2 CNG variants: S MT and SX MT. The Hyundai Exter will be equipped with a 1.2-liter four-cylinder naturally-aspirated petrol engine as the sole powertrain option. This engine will be available with 5-speed manual and 5-speed AMT gearbox options, delivering 83 bhp of power and 114 Nm of maximum torque. This is the same engine that Hyundai offers with other models like the Grand i10 Nios, Aura, and naturally-aspirated variants of the Venue.
Hyundai has also revealed that the Exter will come with 26 safety features across all variants and as an option in the entry-level E and S trims. The safety features of the forthcoming SUV will include ESC (Electronic Stability Control), VSM (Vehicle Stability Management), HAC (Hill Assist Control), 3-Point Seat Belt & seatbelt reminder (all seats), ABS with EBD, Burglar Alarm (1st in Segment), and more. The Exter will also be the only car in the segment to offer features like a built-in dashboard camera and TPMS. Other advanced safety features include ISOFIX anchors, headlamp escort function, rear parking camera, and others.

Vodafone has reneged on its promise not to raise my broadband price,2023-06-15T06:00:24.000000000+00:00,"It stated clearly the cost of a two-year contract would not go up – but then it did
In January I signed a two-year broadband deal with Vodafone at £58 a month. There was a lot of publicity about in-contract price rises, and so I was reassured by a highlighted red box on the contract summary stating that the monthly cost at the end of my minimum term would be £58 – ie, no price rise for 24 months. The covering email pointed out that the contract summary is “an important document that … will form part of your contract if you choose to buy from us”. Two months later, Vodafone informed me the charge would be £66.35 a month. I complained, but it had started taking the money. I suspect I won’t be the only customer affected, in which case Vodafone could be making millions from breaking its contract terms.
SR, Kibworth, Leicestershire
There is no ambiguity in your contract. A box highlighted in scarlet on the first page blares the promise that you will still be paying £58 a month at the end of two years. The cover letter makes it clear that the terms are binding if you sign. On you, but not on Vodafone, it seems. In response to your complaints, the company blamed an error on the contract and insisted on its right to raise the charges. All it would offer was the chance to exit the agreement early and without the usual termination charge. It instructed you to bin the new hub if you do this.
Vodafone’s response to me was laconic. It told me what I already knew – it had offered you a right to terminate without penalty. When pressed, it blithely admitted “an error in part of the contract summary”. The most prominent part, that is. It apologised for the confusion.
This is not good enough. Contract law does allow traders to refuse to sell an item, or a service, at the price advertised, if they discover, at the point of purchase, that there was a mistake, but you were two months into your contract when the error came to light. I consulted consumer lawyer Gary Rycroft, partner with Joseph A Jones, who thinks the contract terms are enforceable. “In contract law, things get more complicated if the business has made an ‘honest mistake’ but it would need to prove how the mistake came about,” he says. ‘‘This ‘honest mistake’ is so minor to Vodafone but major to the customer that Vodafone should be forced to honour the deal.”
When I sent this opinion to Vodafone it focused the corporate mind wonderfully. You have now been refunded the price increase for the last two months, and offered a £14 a month discount until next April. This means you’ll be paying £52.35. The idea is that the £5.75 saving on the original monthly sum will protect you from any price rises next year.
Anyone else in an unresolved dispute with a provider can complain to the Communication and Internet Services Adjudication Scheme.

Siemens to Make €2 Billion Investment to Boost High-Tech Plants,2023-06-15T06:00:00.000000000+00:00,"Siemens AG will invest €2 billion ($2.2 billion) to expand high-tech manufacturing, including a new plant in Singapore and an expansion at its Chinese plant in Chengdu.
In Singapore, the German industrial conglomerate is spending €200 million to build a new plant that will produce factory automation devices to meet rising demand in Southeast Asian markets, Siemens said Thursday. Its digital factory in China will add some 400 jobs through investing €140 million alongside a new research and development center.
Additional plans for Europe and the US will also be announced this year, the company said in a statement. Development spending will go up by an additional €500 million.
Siemens is profiting from a strategic revamp toward efficiency-boosting, software-driven product lines with higher profit margins. The company also known for making high-speed trains raised its outlook twice in fiscal 2023 as revenues and orders grew in its main businesses while the company still sat on a record order backlog of €105 billion in May.
Its digital industries division, which focuses on labor-saving factory automation devices, is expected to deliver a profit margin of as much as 23.5% in the fiscal year through September. Its smart infrastructure unit also raised guidance. The unit helps industrial customers reduce their carbon footprint with a combination of hardware and software offerings."

US must retaliate over European Union's anti-Google protectionism,2023-06-15T06:00:00.000000000+00:00,"One of the European Union's two executive bodies, the European Commission (EC), continues to wage economic war against United States companies.
The EC espouses views on economic regulation at odds with common sense and with the fundamental purposes of antitrust law. Those purposes are economic efficiency and consumer welfare . The purpose of economic regulation is not to subsidize businesses that are less efficient and significantly less innovative.
BIDEN FAMILY BUSINESS NEEDS ITS OWN SPECIAL COUNSEL
On Wednesday, however, the EC told Google of its preliminary view that the company breached EU antitrust rules by distorting competition in the advertising technology industry.
The EC says Google favors its own online display advertising technology services and not providers of competing advertising technology services, advertisers, and online publishers. The EC is silent on Google’s inherent property right to conduct its business as it chooses as long as consumer welfare is promoted.
The EC is also silent on the possibility that in today’s digital world, the advertising technology industry is a natural monopoly. Scale promotes economic efficiency. It is the duty of the EC to promote the welfare of its citizens and to encourage economic efficiency which drives prosperity for all. For example, when a person shops at a grocery store, that person has no right to object to how the store displays its products. The supermarket is free to promote its store brands over branded products. The supermarket exists to make a profit, not to subsidize competitors. Profit and choice are inherent in capitalism.
The EC has already fined Google billions of dollars for other alleged violations of EC economic laws. Now the EC proposes that Google divest itself of a portion of its display advertising technology services. In effect, the EC is strangling the operations of Google in the EU.
Washington should not tolerate this blatant economic attack on American interests.
The U.S. should retaliate against the EC by imposing reciprocal sanctions on companies headquartered in the EU. The Biden administration could impose tariffs on EU-produced goods exported to the U.S. under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. Pursuant to that act, the president can impose tariffs on imports that pose a threat to national security.
Strangling the business operations of one of America’s most successful companies, a company that employs 190,000 people and has a market value of over $1.5 trillion, is a direct economic attack on the U.S.
If the economic war against Google was not a sufficient predicate for imposing tariffs against the EU, then the European Parliament’s very recent approval of regulations on artificial intelligence is additional, clear, and convincing evidence that the EU is declaring economic war against the U.S. EU artificial intelligence regulations will stifle the development of AI.
AI is the high ground in the battle for technological and economic supremacy among the U.S., the EU, and China. AI offers the potential to double secular productivity growth in the U.S. AI could add $4 trillion to global economic output. That increased rate of productivity growth would have profound benefits for the national security of the U.S. as well as for the economic welfare of all Americans.
The administration and Congress have a duty to respond in kind against the EU.

"Amazon launches affordable Prime Lite plan in India: See price, benefits",2023-06-15T06:00:00.000000000+00:00,"Amazon has introduced a new Prime Lite subscription tier for users in India. This will be a cheaper version of the Prime membership with lesser benefits. Amazon Prime Lite comes with just one annual subscription plan, unlike the Prime membership.
Amazon Prime Lite: Price, how to sign up
Amazon Prime Lite is launched at Rs 999 for 12 months. On the other hand, an Amazon Prime membership costs you Rs 1,499 for a year in India.
Amazon Prime Lite is available on Android, iOS and web for users in India. They can choose any of these platforms to sign up for this plan now. Anyone who is not a Prime member can subscribe to the new and cheaper version of Amazon’s premium membership.

Amazon Prime Lite vs Amazon Prime
Apart from the difference in pricing, Amazon Prime Lite comes with lesser benefits than compared to Prime membership. Amazon Prime Lite does not come with access to Amazon Music, Prime Reading, Prime Gaming, and Prime Advantage benefits. For the unversed, under Prime Advantage benefits, users can get no-cost EMI on smartphone purchases and up to 6 months of free screen replacement on select devices.
The Amazon website also mentions that Amazon Prime Lite subscribers will not be able to access the Prime Video OTT platform on web browser. In addition to this, the Lite subscribers can only access Prime Video on two devices simultaneously with resolution limited to HD quality. Prime members can stream content in up to 4K resolution on up to 4 devices simultaneously.
The company has not yet announced if users will see ads on the OTT platform. It was earlier rumoured that just like Netflix, Amazon is also working on an ad-tier subscription plan for the users.
Just like Prime members, Amazon Prime Lite subscribers will get free two-day delivery. The Lite plan subscribers also have the option to pay an additional Rs 175 to get morning delivery on eligible products. Additionally, subscribers will also get free no-rush shipping to eligible addresses where they will get Rs 25 cashback on each order.
Amazon Prime Lite members will also get unlimited 5 per cent reward points for purchases on Amazon with Amazon Pay ICICI credit card and exclusive Prime deals and early access on Amazon.

"Goldman, Citigroup begin cutting about 35 investment banking jobs across Asia, say sources",2023-06-15T06:00:00.000000000+00:00,"HONG KONG – Goldman Sachs Group and Citigroup are starting to cut another 35 investment banking jobs across Asia this week, after revenue from stock sales and mergers slumped further in the second quarter, people familiar with the matter said.
Goldman made a fresh round of reductions affecting about 15 dealmakers, including nine from equity capital markets, the people said. Citigroup may eliminate more than 20 jobs, mostly at junior levels, one of the people said.
Wall Street’s investment banks continue to face a muted environment for dealmaking as macroeconomic concerns and tumultuous markets constrain mergers and acquisitions (M&A).
Equity offerings in Asia-Pacific slumped by almost a third in the second quarter from the first three months, while announced M&A deals fell 21 per cent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
The final number of jobs to be made redundant has not been decided, the people said.
China cuts
While many banks are eliminating jobs globally, the cuts in Asia – and China in particular – are the biggest in years.
China’s economy is struggling to get back on its feet after years of Covid-19 restrictions and crackdowns on everything from financial technology to private education and real estate.

More rounds of cuts are being eyed at the biggest banks, according to interviews with senior executives.
Morgan Stanley in May made another round of reductions affecting 7 per cent of its Asia-Pacific investment bankers, with more than 40 jobs at risk.
China-focused bankers are taking the biggest hit as deteriorating relations with the United States and weaker economic growth curb dealmaking.
Globally, Goldman is working on its third round of staff cuts in under a year.
It eliminated hundreds of jobs in September, followed by another 3,200 at the start of 2023.
The moves this time are expected to impact fewer than 250 people, and will include more senior employees, Bloomberg News reported.
Citigroup started cutting hundreds of jobs across the company earlier in 2023, and is planning to shed 30 investment banking jobs and 20 more at its corporate bank in London, people familiar said last week.
Citigroup chief financial officer Mark Mason said at a conference on Wednesday that he is expecting severance costs tied to the departure of 1,600 employees in the second quarter, and that so far in 2023 the firm has set aside severance for 5,000 employees affected by job cuts. BLOOMBERG"
Norway Firm Produces World’s First Aluminum Using Green Hydrogen,2023-06-15T06:00:00.000000000+00:00,"Norsk Hydro ASA has made the world’s first batch of aluminum using green hydrogen in a step toward decarbonizing the production of the metal.
The Norwegian producer replaced natural gas with green hydrogen during a test at its extrusion plant in Navarra, Spain, it said in a statement on Thursday. Hydro’s renewable hydrogen company, Hydro Havrand, conducted the trial in partnership with Fives North America Combustion, an engineering firm with expertise in hydrogen burner technology.
For more than a century, Hydro has been searching for new uses for the vast amounts of hydroelectric power that Norway generates each year. The company first found success making artificial fertilizers via a pioneering electrochemical process, and later focused its attention on aluminum, which is one of the world’s most energy-intensive industrial commodities to make. Now, it’s betting that hydrogen could prove even more lucrative.
“Green hydrogen can remove hard to abate emissions from fossil fuels in processes where electricity is not an alternative, both in the aluminum industry and in other heavy industries,” Per Christian Eriksen, head of Hydro Havrand, said. “This test is part of developing commercial fuel switch solutions and to demonstrate that hydrogen can be used in aluminum production.”
Hydro will publish a final report from the test in the fall. The aluminum produced in the test will be utilized to make the world’s first extruded profiles using hydrogen.
“It’s a very powerful message to our customers rather than a powerpoint on net zero 2050 which everyone has,” Paul Warton, executive vice president for Hydro Extrusions, said in an interview. “We can say this is how we will do it.”"
Australian state bans PwC from new tax contracts for three months,2023-06-15T06:00:00.000000000+00:00,"An Australian state on Thursday imposed a three-month ban on PricewaterhouseCoopers' (PwC) local unit from receiving new tax-related contracts - the latest repercussion to hit the firm after its misuse of confidential federal government tax plans.
PwC has come under fire after a former tax partner in the firm who was advising the Australian federal government on laws to prevent corporate tax avoidance shared confidential drafts with colleagues that were used to pitch to companies for work.
The action by New South Wales, home to Sydney and Australia's most populous state, is a ""proportionate response to the current investigations involving PwC,"" Courtney Houssos, the state's finance minister, said.
PwC will also be required to remove staff with links to the leak from all contract works for the state government - a move that the federal government has also demanded and PwC has agreed to. Last week, PwC named at least 67 current and former staff involved in the leak of government tax plans.
""I was appalled by the breach of trust that occurred with the federal government. As additional evidence comes to light we will continue to toughen our regime and protect the ... community from this behaviour,"" Houssos said in a statement.
PwC, one of the world's ""big four"" audit and advisory firms, declined to comment. Acting CEO Kristin Stubbins apologised for the leak on behalf of the firm in an open letter last month.
The Australian Federal Police is investigating the misuse of confidential government documents and four major pension funds have paused work with the firm. Some private-sector clients and government agencies have also suspended or are reviewing their dealings with PwC."

Flipkart's Former Top Executive Anil Goteti Launches Travel Fintech Startup,2023-06-15T05:50:00.000000000+00:00,"Flipkart's former Senior Vice-President Anil Goteti has launched a travel credit card startup named Scapia, targeted at young travellers.
Bengaluru-based Scapia has been operating in stealth mode over the last year, and its primary product is a credit card and app targeted at Gen-Z and millennials.
The card claims to offer 10% rewards on every transaction, which can be redeemed in lieu of discounted flights and hotel stays across the globe, the company said in a statement on Thursday.
The credit card has been introduced in partnership with Federal Bank Ltd. and is based on the VISA network. ""Customers can use the card in over 150 countries across a million merchants and access transactions in real-time within the Scapia app,"" it said.
It is also venturing into the BNPL space, offering a no-cost EMI option named 'Travel Now, Pay Later.'
Scapia was founded by Goteti, who started his career with Flipkart in 2012 as a director of the books and eBooks segment. Over time, he handled various categories, such as mobiles and furniture, before resigning in 2020 to start up on his own.

"Spotify confirms removal of ‘Glory to Hong Kong’ protest song, points to action by tune’s creator-distributor",2023-06-15T05:47:35.000000000+00:00,"Move follows similar dropping of anti-government tune on other music-streaming platforms, as city authorities seek ban
Creator ‘ThomasDGX & HongKongers’ says it is facing technical issues and apologises for temporary service disruption, but does not elaborate
Music-streaming service Spotify on Thursday said popular versions of controversial protest song “Glory to Hong Kong” had been removed by its distributor, echoing an earlier statement by the tune’s creator the night before.
Cantonese and instrumental versions of the song, popular with protesters during the 2019 anti-government unrest, became unavailable to users of Spotify and other music-streaming platforms, including Taiwan’s KKBox, Hong Kong’s Moov and Apple Music, on Wednesday.
A week earlier, the Hong Kong government filed for a court injunction to ban the song, preventing those harbouring criminal intent from “broadcasting, performing, printing, publishing, selling, offering for sale, distributing, disseminating, displaying or reproducing” the tune “in any way”.
A spokeswoman for Spotify on Thursday said in a short statement provided to the Post that the songs were removed by the distributor instead of the platform.
“ThomasDGX & HongKongers”, which created and distributed the versions in question, had said it was handling technical issues unrelated to streaming platforms, and apologised for the temporary service disruption.
Popular versions of Hong Kong protest song disappear from music streaming platforms
The nature of the “technical issues” faced by the creator and length of the disruption, however, remained unclear. A music video of “Glory to Hong Kong” uploaded by the same creator was still available on YouTube as of Thursday morning.
The Post has approached other streaming platforms KKBox, Moov, Apple Music, as well as Google which owns YouTube for comment.
Hong Kong court postpones hearing on government’s bid to ban protest song
The government has publicised a writ of summons and other documents related to the proposed ban ahead of a hearing set for July 21, calling on anyone in objection to obtain the relevant documents at Wan Chai Police Station before June 21 and file their opposition in writing within seven days.
The proposed ban came after organisers of several overseas sports events had wrongly played “Glory to Hong Kong” instead of Chinese national anthem “March of the Volunteers”. Most of the errors stemmed from top search results on Google for “Hong Kong national anthem”.
The California-based tech giant has refused to alter what it said were algorithm-determined results, prompting a warning by Beijing that the company had an obligation to disseminate correct information."
"A Hollywood actors strike looms, as writers continue to picket",2023-06-15T05:46:00.000000000+00:00,"As the movie and television writers strike drags on, another Hollywood union could enter the fray.
The Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television & Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) — which represents some 160,000 actors for film, television and video games; broadcast journalists; recording artists; influencers, and other personalities — are seeking to reach a deal on a new contract before their current one expires on June 30.
Should SAG-AFTRA and the production companies and studios, represented by the Alliance of Motion Picture & Television Producers (AMPTP), fail to meet that deadline, the union has voted to authorize a strike for television and film productions.
The union said news and broadcast work would not be directly affected by a strike, but how each local newsroom and station would respond is unclear.
Today, Chicago unions will gather once again in front of the CBS building in the Loop to support striking Writers Guild of America, or WGA, members as their walkout passes the one-month mark. The rally's organizers said the event is also to cheer on SAG-AFTRA union members as they head into negotiations.
Like the WGA, SAG-AFTRA members overwhelmingly live in New York and Los Angeles. Of the roughly 160,000 total members, 5,400 live in Illinois, Wisconsin and Indiana, according to the SAG-AFTRA Chicago chapter.
The Chicago chapter said members work in broadcasting at all the local stations, including ABC-7 Chicago (WLS-TV), NBC-5 Chicago (WMAQ-TV), Fox 32 Chicago (WFLD-TV) and WGN-TV. The union also has workers at most local radio stations including iHeartMedia's eight stations, WBEZ, Audacy and Cumulus stations, in addition to performers in film and television series.
It is unclear how local radio and television broadcasts would respond to a work stoppage, especially if it required crossing picket lines. For now, union leaders say radio and television broadcasts would not be affected by a strike.
The union, like WGA members, is seeking better pay and job security in an entertainment industry some say has been upended by streaming services and further disrupted by emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence.
“As we enter what may be one of the most consequential negotiations in the union’s history, inflation, dwindling residuals due to streaming and generative AI all threaten actors’ ability to earn a livelihood if our contracts are not adapted to reflect the new realities,” SAG-AFTRA’s national executive director and chief negotiator, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, said in a written statement after the June 5 strike authorization vote.
Should a deal not be reached in time, two of Hollywood’s largest unions would join picket lines with the potential to grind new movie and television production to a halt. In Illinois, at stake is more than half a billion dollars in revenue spent by the film and television industry here. Last year, the state announced a record high of $700 million spent by film and television companies in the state.
While most of the state’s entertainment industry is on hiatus during the summer months, the early effects of the writers' strike are still being felt. Picketing writers were able to shut down production on Showtime's television show ""The Chi"" in May. And if the strikes outlast the summer, expect more delays in productions.

“As we enter what may be one of the most consequential negotiations in the union’s history, inflation, dwindling residuals due to streaming and generative AI all threaten actors’ ability to earn a livelihood if our contracts are not adapted to reflect the new realities,” SAG-AFTRA’s national executive director and chief negotiator, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, said in a written statement after the June 5 strike authorization vote.
Should a deal not be reached in time, two of Hollywood’s largest unions would join picket lines with the potential to grind new movie and television production to a halt. In Illinois, at stake is more than half a billion dollars in revenue spent by the film and television industry here. Last year, the state announced a record high of $700 million spent by film and television companies in the state.
While most of the state’s entertainment industry is on hiatus during the summer months, the early effects of the writers' strike are still being felt. Picketing writers were able to shut down production on Showtime's television show ""The Chi"" in May. And if the strikes outlast the summer, expect more delays in productions.

TikTok’s CEO Says It Plans to Invest Billions in Southeast Asia,2023-06-15T05:35:00.000000000+00:00,"ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok will invest billions of dollars in Southeast Asia over the next three to five years, as the Chinese behemoth moves to strengthen the presence of its hit video app in the region.
TikTok Chief Executive Officer Shou Zi Chew said the company wants to “invest proportionately” to the opportunity Southeast Asia presents. TikTok has over 8,000 people in the region and close to 2,000 staff in Indonesia, he said during an event held in Jakarta on Thursday.
TikTok is betting on markets such as Indonesia to spur growth for its e-commerce arm — which lets users buy items while scrolling through an endless feed of short videos and livestreams. Gross merchandise value, which represents the total worth of goods sold through its TikTok Shop offering, surpassed $2.5 billion in Indonesia last year and topped $1 billion in the first three months of 2023, according to e-commerce research firm Cube Asia.
TikTok’s push into e-commerce is creating a growing challenge to rivals, including Amazon.com Inc. and Sea Ltd.’s Shopee. The Chinese-owned company aims to more than quadruple the size of its global e-commerce business to as much as $20 billion in merchandise sales this year as it expands into the US and Europe, Bloomberg reported last week.
ByteDance, founded more than a decade ago by Zhang Yiming and Liang Rubo, grew into an internet leader worth more than $200 billion thanks to the virality of short-video platforms TikTok and Douyin. Though live shopping hasn’t caught on in the US and Europe despite attempts by Instagram and others, TikTok is basing its projections on the success of Douyin, a Chinese version of TikTok that has surged in popularity on its home turf.

Dubai's Tecom Group secures 5-year Dh7.6b refinance on favourable terms,2023-06-15T05:34:05.000000000+00:00,"Dubai: The Tecom Group - the Dubai headquartered operator of free zones and industrial hubs - has refinanced an existing loan on 'more favourable term'. It has entered a new 5-year Dh7.6 billion unsecured loan facility and replacing the existing partially utilised loan of a similar size.
The switch will have a 'positive impact on the company’s cashflow profile', and providing the funds to 'execute its growth strategy'. Several leading UAE businesses have or are in the process of refinancing their debt exposures, even as the US Federal Reserve hit pause on an interest rate hike in June. (But the Fed did leave open the chances of more rate hikes in the year.)
Tecom's facility has been 'secured at more favourable terms, leading to immediate interest expense saving over the five-year period'. It provides drawdown flexibility until maturity and also increases the duration of the facility. Under the terms, the exposure will be split into an Dh4.4 billion term loan, equivalent to the amount already drawn down from the previous agreement.
Then there is the Dh3.2 billion revolving credit facility, equal to the existing undrawn amount. The facility has a bullet principal repayment structure, with the principal amount repaid at maturity.

""The new facility demonstrates our ability to leverage our strong financial standing and performance, market reputation and leadership position within the commercial real estate segment to take advantage of the ample liquidity in the UAE banking sector,"" said Abdulla Belhoul, CEO. ""Securing the loan at more favourable terms is a reflection of the confidence the financial community has in our business and growth plans.”
Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, Emirates NBD Capital, and Dubai Islamic Bank were the joint mandated lead arrangers.
""We entered into a loan agreement that will have an accretive impact on our bottom-line,"" said Michael Wunderbaldinger, Chief Financial Officer at Tecom Group. ""The facility will also lower our financial costs, improve our cash profile and is more aligned with our funding needs over the coming period.”"

Opposition MPs to discuss former Twitter CEO's 'Pressure' remark in Parliamentary panel meet today,2023-06-15T05:34:00.000000000+00:00,"As the controversy escalates following former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey's claim that the Indian Government threatened to shut down the platform's operations in the country, opposition party Members of Parliament (MPs) are poised to address the issue during the upcoming meeting of the Parliamentary Standing Committee for Communication and Information Technology (IT) on Thursday.
As per a report by ANI, an opposition party MP said, “We will raise the recent statement of the former CEO of Twitter Jack Dorsey's allegation in which the Government of India threatened to block Twitter during the farmer protests in the country. We would seek a response from the official attending the meeting today on behalf of the government.""
The MP further stressed that the Opposition MPs want the chairman to allow the issue concerned with Dorsey's ""pressure"" remark to be raised in the meeting and the government to respond to it.
A parliamentary standing committee, led by Lok Sabha MP Jadhav Prataprao Ganpatrao from the Shiv Sena (Shinde faction), is scheduled to convene today. The committee has been summoned to address the crucial topics of citizen data security and privacy.
The committee agenda read, “Evidence of the representatives of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology on the subject 'Citizens' data security and privacy.""
The parliamentary committee comprises a total of 31 members representing various parties from both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.
In a recent interview aired on a YouTube channel, the former CEO of Twitter made allegations suggesting that the Indian government had issued threats to close down the microblogging platform.
In an interview, Dorsey had noted that India is one of the countries which had many requests around farmers' protests, around particular journalists who were critical of the government and it manifested in ways such as we will shut Twitter down in India, India is a big marketplace for us. “We would raid the homes of your employees, which they did and we will shut down your offices if you don't follow suit and this is India, a democratic country.""
Earlier on Tuesday, on Tuesday, Union Minister of State for Electronics and Information Technology Rajeev Chandrasekhar hit out at Jack Dorsey's Indian government's ""pressure"" remark. Chandrasekhar alleged that between 2020 and 2022, Twitter was found violating Indian law multiple times and the platform had started to comply with the law only in 2022.
Reacting to Dorsey's claim, Rajeev Chandrasekhar called it ""an outright lie"" and ""an attempt to brush out the very dubious period"" of the social media company's history. He said that Twitter ""weaponised misinformation"" against Indians and the government of India during the period of 2020.
Speaking to ANI, Chandrasekhar said, ""Twitter which is now in the public domain, during this period, was not only partisan but was behaving in an absolutely arbitrary manner and the Twitter files that have then come out after Jack Dorsey sold Twitter exposed it to be a platform that abused its power, misused its power.""
""Between 2020-2022, Twitter violated Indian law multiple times. It started complying with the law only in 2022. During that entire period, nobody went to jail, and nobody was raided,"" Chandrasekhar said.

Major music companies sue Twitter for making money off copyright infringed work,2023-06-15T05:33:00.000000000+00:00,"Three major music conglomerates namely, Universal, Sony, and Warner have jointly sued Twitter for $250 million over the alleged infringement of music that belongs to them. This matter concerns about 1700 works for which the social media platform received hundreds of takedown notices but did nothing. The lawsuit accuses Twitter of mass copyright infringement.
Twitter making money off someone else's music, claims suit
The trio alleges that Twitter “fuels its business” by “consistently and knowingly hosts and streams infringing copies of music compositions”. The lawsuit claims that Twitter has never tried to obtain the proper licenses for running its music.
Currently, Twitter is the only major social media platform without music licensing deals. Hence it allows websites to legally host videos and other content featuring publishers’ music. Meanwhile, other platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and Snapchat have entered into agreements that compensate creators of musical compositions for the use of their work.
The lawsuit against Twitter was filed in a court in Tennessee, United States. The lawsuit reads, “The availability of videos with music, including copies of Publishers’ musical compositions, furthers Twitter’s financial interests both because it drives user engagement, and thus advertising revenue, and because Twitter does not pay fees to license musical compositions from Publishers and other music rights holders. Indeed, providing free, unlicensed music gives the Twitter platform an unfair advantage over competing platforms.”
Twitter doesn't punish repeat offenders who infringe, claims suit
The complaint points out examples of repeat offenders who have been issued notices of infringement time and again but have done nothing about it since the host platform doesn’t levy any penalty. “Twitter then monetizes those tweets and users via advertising, subscriptions, and data licensing, all of which serve to increase Twitter’s valuation and revenues,” states the filing.
The publishers stress that Twitter failed to implement a policy to terminate repeat infringers. The suit claims, “Users who repeatedly infringe copyrights do not face a realistic prospect of permanently losing access to their accounts on the Twitter platform. Rather than terminating access to specific users brought to its attention as infringers, which would have stopped or limited their infringement and deterred others from infringing, Twitter has operated its platform to be a haven for infringing activity.”
Music companies are seeking $150,000 for each infringed work
The lawsuit is seeking $150,000 for each infringed work. It claims direct copyright infringement, contributory infringement, and vicarious infringement. The 17 publishers that sued are represented by the National Music Publishers Association. They include Anthem Entertainment, Big Machine Music, BMG Rights Management, Kobalt Music Publishing America, and Spirit Music Group, among others.

TSM - 3 Cheap Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now,2023-06-15T05:31:00.000000000+00:00,"2023-06-15 05:31:00 ET
Investors have noticed the market's sustained upward moves this year. The trend is increasingly difficult to ignore as some stocks reach valuations reminiscent of 2021.
If the recent increases become a sustained bull market , investors will want to take a closer look at stocks the rally has thus far missed.

Delhi Police ASI Robbed Using PhonePe Cashback Scam: Scammers Caught After Extracting ₹2 Lakh,2023-06-15T05:30:00.000000000+00:00,"A new scam was discovered after a senior police official in the Delhi police force was robbed of more than ₹2 Lakh. The scammers lured the victim using the traditional baiting method but deployed a comparatively new tactic to extract money via digital routes.
Digital thieves posing as police officials or exploiting the ""Request Money"" feature in UPI apps are quite common. However, this time victim was a Delhi Police ASI, who was defrauded. Let's look at the details of this new type of scam.
According to the PTI report, the Delhi Police official was tempted by scammers using the old ""You've won cashback on transactions made using PhonePe."" The police official, unaware of the scam and the scammers, revealed he has used PhonePe and made payments using the app.
Instead of using common scamming techniques, this time, the scammers asked the victim to download a different app that was not affiliated with PhonePe. This should have been a clear warning sign, but the victim obliged.
It is not clear which third-party app was downloaded but scammers gained unauthorized access to the victim's smartphone. Once compromised, the smartphone was used to execute transactions worth ₹2,12,000 from the official's bank account and credit card.
The money was transferred to a digital wallet belonging to the couple, which was linked to five different bank accounts. These details surfaced because the police officer took quick steps after realizing he was duped.
Quick Action Helped Delhi Police Official Recover Entire Scammed Amount
Realizing he was being scammed, the police official quickly filed an FIR. Thereafter the cybercrime unit of Delhi Police, in association with the victim's banks, took swift action.
The stolen amount has been reportedly returned to the Delhi Police official. Police also recovered chequebooks, ATM cards, and passbooks belonging to scammers. This evidence not only helped the investigation but may also help uncover similar crimes.
This scam once again highlights the potential dangers of smartphone apps. Delhi Police have cautioned smartphone users never to download any separate app for cashback or rewards. Such offers are usually provided within the main app, and moreover, the service providers usually send a notification for the same.
If any user falls victim and loses money, they should immediately, without any delay, approach their nearest police station and file an FIR. Additionally, victims must file a grievance report with the financial institution's helpdesk. This method is applicable to all digital financial transaction methods, apps, and instruments."
Kinship care: Families call for same support as adoptive parents,2023-06-15T05:29:00.000000000+00:00,"Research by the Kinship charity found a high proportion of kinship carers were being forced out of work due to not being entitled to paid leave
By Emma Glasbey & David McKenna
BBC News
People who take in relatives' children should get the same level of support as adoptive parents, a charity has said.
Research by the Kinship charity found a high proportion of kinship carers were leaving their jobs due to not being entitled to paid leave.
The charity said 68% of employers did not offer any support to kinship carers, such as flexible working hours.
A Department for Education (DfE) spokesperson said a plan for improving kinship care was due to published.
According to the research, eight in 10 kinship carers either gave up work or reduced their hours after taking on the care of a child, the charity said.
Kinship's chief executive Dr Lucy Peake said: ""These findings show the sharp contrast between workplace support given to adopters and parents, and that which is available to kinship carers.
""Time and time again, kinship carers tell us that they have been pushed out of jobs because they stepped up to care for a child who was in need of a stable home.""
She added there needed to be a legal requirement for carers to have the same access to paid leave and other workplace entitlements as parents and adopters.
Sandra, from Huddersfield, said she was not entitled to paid leave after taking on the responsibility for the care of a family member's new-born baby
Sandra, from Huddersfield, was given three weeks paid leave after she took on caring for a family member's new-born baby.
However, she said ""In the finish I had to give up my job"", the former school IT technician added it would have made a difference if she had been given time off on a maternity basis.
HR worker Katie, from West Yorkshire, said her employer had offered support when she found herself in a similar situation.
""I feel incredibly privileged that they gave me the time and the flexibility I needed,"" she said.
However, she added: ""I shouldn't need to feel privileged.
""It's not a privilege for a child to need you to care for them - it should be a given,"" she said.
In a statement, a DfE spokesperson said: ""Kinship carers provide crucial support to some of our most vulnerable children [and] our new children's social care strategy sets out how we will provide them with more support.
""We're also providing £47m to help more children stay in loving homes, including with extended family members, and exploring options for additional workplace entitlements for some kinship carers.
""At the end of this year we will publish a national kinship care strategy,"" they added.

Sony Pictures Networks India has announced the third season of its business reality show Shark Tank India.
Shark Tank India has been adapted from an American reality series, that shows entrepreneurs making business presentations to a panel of five investors or sharks, who decide whether to invest in their companies.

Trump's call for 'end' of constitution condemned by Democrats,2023-06-15T05:26:00.000000000+00:00,"Getty Images
By Matt Murphy
BBC News
The White House has condemned former President Donald Trump after he called for the ""termination"" of the US constitution.
Mr Trump made the comments in a post to his Truth social network on Saturday while repeating his false claim that he won the 2020 presidential election.
He also accused ""Big Tech Companies"" of colluding against him with Democrats.
White House spokesman Andrew Bates said Mr Trump's comments were ""anathema to the soul of our nation"".
""You cannot only love America when you win,"" Mr Bates said in a statement.
He added that Mr Trump's comments should be ""universally condemned"" - seemingly a pointed jab at senior Republicans who have so far avoided criticising the former president's outburst.
Other senior Democrats also challenged Republicans - including Rep Eric Swalwell who questioned how the party's members could continue to refer to themselves as ""Constitutional conservatives"" if they didn't condemn the comments.
In the post, Mr Trump referred to vague allegations of ""massive & widespread fraud and deception"" and asked whether he should be immediately returned to power.
""A Massive Fraud of this type and magnitude allows for the termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution. Our great 'Founders' did not want, and would not condone, False & Fraudulent Elections!"" he said.
The post came just hours after Twitter's internal deliberations around limiting a 2020 story about Hunter Biden were revealed.
The story, which came weeks ahead of the 2020 presidential election, was published by the New York Post and revealed the chaotic personal life and business dealings of President Joe Biden's youngest son.
Twitter initially blocked the story because of a company policy on hacked and stolen materials, and the leaked emails showed confusion and disagreements among staff as they scrambled to respond.
The files - which the BBC cannot verify - were published on Twitter by Substack writer Matt Taibbi on Friday night.
But last week, Twitter owner Elon Musk hinted that he would release the information, writing on the platform: ""This is necessary to restore public trust.""
The billionaire defended the move in a Twitter spaces live stream on Saturday, but he accepted there may be a ""legal risk"" to his decision.
""We're just going to put all the information out there try to get a clean slate,"" Mr Musk said. He added that legal risks were ""less of a concern than just clearing the air and making sure that people know what really happened"".
Mr Trump announced his third presidential bid last month and remains the favourite to seal the Republican nomination in 2024.
But he has come under fire this week after dining with a known white nationalist and Holocaust denier at his Florida home.
Mr Trump said he was not aware that the man would be present and said he had accompanied the rapper Kanye West - who earlier this week expressed admiration for Adolf Hitler and has been accused of a host of anti-semitic comments.

Elon Musk's Twitter is being sued for $250 million. Here's why,2023-06-15T05:25:00.000000000+00:00,"Elon Musk-owned Twitter is getting sued for a whopping $250 million for infringing on nearly 1,700 copyrights by the National Music Publishers’ Association. The association includes major music publishers including Sony Music, Publishing, BMG Rights Management, Universal Music Publishing, and Warner Chappell.
In a lawsuit filed in the US, the music publishers alleged that Twitter profits handsomely from the ‘infringement of Publishers’ repertoires of musical compositions.’ They claimed that Twitter rebuffed the demands to obtain licenses for the musical composition used on the platform.
NMPA argue that things have changed even after the acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk, they wrote, “Both before and after the sale, Twitter has engaged in, knowingly facilitated, and profited from copyright infringement, at the expense of music creators, to whom Twitter pays nothing.""
“By design, the Twitter platform became a hot destination for multimedia content, with music-infused videos being of particular and paramount importance"" the music publisher's association added
NMPA President David Israelite also argued in a statement that Twitter is the only large social media platform to completely refuse to license millions of songs on its service. The petition also claims that other well-known social media platforms like TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat have entered into agreements with right holders that allow for compensation of music composers.
In the petition, NMPA explained that Twitter started out as a destination for short text-based messages. However, Twitter quickly turned into a destination for multimedia content in order to compete with other social media platforms.
The publishers alleged that Twitter knowingly hosts infringing copies of musical compositions and fails to make even the most steps in expeditiously removing, or disabling access to, the infringing material. They also alleged that the social media giant ignores repeat offenders in order to increase engagement and ad revenue while getting an unfair advantage over the competitors."
"North Korean hackers create fake web portal, South's spy agency says",2023-06-15T05:25:00.000000000+00:00,"SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean hackers have set up a fake website that looks almost identical to the popular South Korean web portal Naver, marking a more sophisticated attempt to target users in the South, Seoul's spy agency said.
The National Intelligence Service (NIS) issued a warning this week, urging people to refrain from accessing the website called ""Naver Portal"" and said it was working with overseas organisations to track down the activity of the group it believed was behind the fake portal.
""North Korea's hacking attacks targeting South Koreans are getting more elaborate,"" the spy agency said in a statement on Wednesday.
Naver, which is operated by the tech giant of the same name, is South Korea's most-used web portal and search engine and offers various services ranging from email, news aggregation and online shopping.
The NIS did not say how many people may have been tricked by the portal or had disclosed personal information.
A Naver representative on Thursday said: ""We urge users to pay attention to the domain address when accessing Naver.""
North Korean hackers have been blamed for cyberattacks netting millions of dollars, though Pyongyang previously has denied being involved in cybercrime.
Earlier this year, the United Nations reported North Korea had stolen more cryptocurrency assets in 2022 than in any other year. International monitors say stolen money has been pumped into North Korea's sanctioned nuclear and missile programs.
More than 70% of North Korean hacking attempts are via emails, most of them pretending to have been sent under the names of South Korean web portals such as Naver and Daum, the NIS said last month, describing them as ""social engineering"" attacks.

Vietnam’s VinFast VF3 wants in on the mini-EV craze,2023-06-15T05:23:00.000000000+00:00,"By now, you probably know the story of VinFast. It was founded by Vietnam’s first billionaire, Pham Nhat Vuong, and he formed the Vingroup empire by starting out with a noodle bar. Vinfast was formed in 2017 and rolled out its first pair of cars in 2019.
A few years on, VinFast is gunning for the EV market by offering a wide portfolio of battery-powered vehicles. At the moment, it has a compact EV crossover, along with a mid-sized and large seven-seat crossover in the mix. But VinFast also wants in on the mini-EV craze that Chinese automakers seem to be dominating at the moment.
Enter, the VF3.

The VinFast VF3 is Vietnam’s answer to China’s mini-EV models. It’s up against models such as the Jetour Ice Cream, the revived Geely Panda, and the imaginatively named Wuling Mini EV. To set it apart, the VF3 is banking on its mini macho-SUV exterior to attract customers. It’s a bit like the Baojun Yep, then.
The VF3 is classified under the mini car market in Vietnam, and it’s just 3,114mm long. For comparison, the three-door version of the Suzuki Jimny is gigantic next to it, as the Japanese SUV measures 3,645mm long. In typical mini-SUV fashion, the VF3 has a tall ride height, chunky fender flares, and a boxy design.
There are no interior photos of the production VF3 just yet. But, if the design sketches are to be believed, the cabin is likely to be an exercise in minimalism. There’s a wraparound dashboard, along with a single screen that serves as the instrument cluster. Despite the size, VinFast claims this mini electric crossover can still fit five people.
As for specs, the Vietnamese automaker has not released it at the time of writing. However, VinFast says the VF 3 will come in two trims, Eco and Plus. The company adds that they aim to make electric mobility more widespread in Vietnam, and the low (predicted) pricing of this model also means It can help fulfill the “car dreams” of millions of families in its home country."

Kairan Quazi, a 14-year-old who made news for graduating from Santa Clara University with a bachelor’s degree and subsequently securing a software engineering job on SpaceX’s Starlink, was also using LinkedIn.
However, earlier this week, LinkedIn decided to delete Quazi’s account on the grounds that he is not yet 16, which is the minimum age requirement to join the platform.

On Tuesday, Quazi shared a screenshot of LinkedIn’s notice that informed him of their decision. In a scathing post, Quazi criticised this move and said, “I can be qualified enough to land one of the most coveted engineering jobs in the world but not qualified enough to have access to a professional social media platform? @LinkedIn showing everyone how regressive some tech company policies are.”"
The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 will get one of the Apple Watch’s best health features,2023-06-15T05:17:54.000000000+00:00,"Samsung has confirmed that the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 will offer irregular heart rhythm notifications when it launches later this year. What’s more, the feature will also arrive on older Samsung watches – but there’s a catch.
In an official press release, Samsung states that irregular heart rhythm notifications will be available in 13 countries, including the US and Samsung’s native Korea. Irregular heart rhythm notifications use your watch’s heart rate monitor to look for signs of atrial fibrillation, a heart condition that can cause an abnormally fast heart rate.
This can be done using an electrocardiogram scan, or ECG, which is often activated manually, but the best smartwatches, including the best Apple Watch models, can also run checks in the background and notify you for potential signs of atrial fibrillation, or AFib, without you needing to run ECGs on a regular basis – instead, the notification will prompt you to take a manual ECG for a more accurate reading.
The feature has been approved by the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), just in time for the likely unveiling of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 in July. The feature will also be introduced in Argentina, Azerbaijan, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Georgia, Guatemala, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Panama, and the UAE, with other countries, including the UK, likely to follow.
After the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 has made its debut, the feature is also said to be “expanding to earlier editions later this year” as part of the One UI 5 Watch software update. However, Samsung is keen for its new flagship watch range to have the feature first, which is the catch – if you own an older model, you’ll have to wait for the feature, or upgrade your watch.
Clearance sale
The feature has only recently been cleared by the FDA, despite the Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 and (presumably) the Galaxy Watch 4 being able to take advantage of this update. Presumably, this is why the press release makes no mention of the feature being approved in other markets, such as the UK or mainland Europe, as it’s still working its way through all that red tape.
This is going to be a recurring problem as smartwatches get more advanced, and manufacturers develop new health-orientated features to put in them: the minute they stray towards being medical devices, they get wrapped up in red tape, and require clearance by third parties and governing bodies for everyday use.
This feature has been available on Apple Watches for a few years now, so you have to wonder what the delay has been on Samsung’s part. It’s a feature many Android watches are missing, as competitors like the Google Pixel Watch still require you to perform manual ECG scans rather than running checks in the background.
Perhaps this will be a feature that’s introduced on the Google Pixel Watch 2 this year, as well as the Galaxy Watch 6.

2 Chainz hosts Amazon Music live concerts using NFL platform,2023-06-15T05:17:20.000000000+00:00,"This is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated. Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.
LOS ANGELES (AP) — 2 Chainz wants to capitalize off the NFL’s huge “Thursday Night Football” platform to feature some of the world’s most popular musical performers on Amazon Music’s live concert series.
The Grammy winner is the host of “Amazon Music Live,” a weekly live show that streams on Prime Video after “Thursday Night Football.” It is filmed each week in front of a live audience in Los Angeles. The concert series, which debuted in late October with guest Lil Baby, has also featured Megan Thee Stallion and Kane Brown. Last month, 2 Chainz took the stage with Lil Wayne, who performed some of his hits, including his verse on DJ Khaled’s “God Did.”
Rapper A$AP Rocky will hit the stage Thursday, and Brazilian singer Anitta is expected to perform next week.
“This is a huge benefit for artists who are able to access one of the biggest platforms on TV, with ‘Thursday Night Football’ having so many viewers, coming on after the game,” 2 Chainz said about the concert series.
“You’re going to be in certain living rooms that you may or may not be privileged to be in,” 2 Chainz said. “I think it helps the overall bigger picture as far as sports and music fusing together.”
In each episode, 2 Chainz interviews the featured artist. He usually reads the questions off a teleprompter, but he sometimes throws in his own topics as well.
2 Chainz credits Vice TV’s “Most Expensivest” for readying him for the challenge of the concert series. He hosts the reality series that explores the most expensive items such as food, jewelry and drinks. The rapper said he just wrapped filming his fourth season.
“That show, I think, has grown me and prepared me for roles like this, where I’m on the other side of the desk,” he said. “With hosting, I’m still holding a microphone. So, it’s still very much a part of the DNA that I’m accustomed to. … like being on stage and rocking out.”
2 Chainz said Amazon reached out to him and his team about a “new vision” of marrying the worlds of football and music. The idea was birthed after Amazon and the NFL entered into an 11-year agreement to air the prime-time professional football games on the streaming service.
The rapper said a strong relationship was already built between him and Amazon Music after partnering to rollout a couple of his albums.
“They needed an Iconic, legendary, handsome, intelligent host to fuse it all together,” he said. “You know, ultimately, I’m the man for the job.”"
NVDA - Nvidia Just Exposed This 1 Key Flaw in AMD's Business -- Is AMD Stock Still a Buy?,2023-06-15T05:16:00.000000000+00:00,"2023-06-15 05:16:00 ET
Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been flirting with the $1 trillion valuation milestone, putting it in the rarefied company of Apple , Microsoft , Alphabet , and Amazon .
All of these companies, Nvidia included, have at least one thing in common: They're platform businesses that generate revenue from enabling interactions and transactions between people and things, rather than simply selling a product. In other words, besides selling a product or service themselves, platforms facilitate the building of other businesses on top of their technology.
How do you build a platform business? One key ingredient is a tight integration between hard assets (in Nvidia's case semiconductors) and software. Nvidia's recent success thus exposes a major flaw in Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) : a lack of software to transform it from a peddler of chips into something much more.

TCS among 4 stocks that turned ex-dividend today,2023-06-15T05:16:00.000000000+00:00,"Shares of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) turned ex-dividend on Thursday along with three other companies -- Visaka Industries, DCB Bank and DJ Mediaprint.
IT major TCS had earlier announced a dividend of Rs 24 per share, which is 2,400% on the face value for the financial year ending March 2023. The company fixed June 15 as the record date to determine the eligibility of shareholders.
Shares of companies usually trade ex-dividend on the day or a day before the record date. When a company goes ex-dividend on a particular date, its stock does not carry the value of the next dividend payment.
In the last 12 months, TCS has paid a dividend of Rs 91 per share to investors, which results in a dividend yield of 2.8%.
On Wednesday, TCS stock closed flat at Rs 3,245 apiece on NSE. The shares have underperformed the benchmark index by falling 0.5% so far this year.
The country's largest software services exporter reported a 17% year-on-year (YoY) rise in its March quarter revenue at Rs 59,162 crore while profit rose 15% YoY to Rs 11,392 crore.
While most analysts are cautious on the IT space including TCS in the near term, Motilal Oswal has a buy tag on the stock, given its ability to withstand the weakening macro environment and ride on the anticipated industry growth.
""The large deal signings remain stronger at 29 in FY23, compared with 18 deals signed in FY22, which gives visibility for sustainable and predictable growth for FY24. Although, FY23 margin performance was a little disappointing, however, it sees multiple levers ahead to drive efficiency and improve margins in FY24,"" Motilal Oswal said.
According to Trendlyne data, TCS has a consensus target price of Rs 3,597, showing an upside of 11% from the current levels.
Apart from TCS, Visaka Industries, which has announced a dividend of Re 0.6, DCB Bank (Rs 1.25 per share) and DJ Mediaprint (Re 0.15 per share) also traded ex-dividend today."
Australia's AGL inks deal with BP to offer discounted EV charging in NSW,2023-06-15T05:16:00.000000000+00:00,"Australia's AGL Energy said on Thursday it had signed a three-year deal with energy giant BP to provide easier access to electric vehicle charging points for users in New South Wales, in a bid to switch towards green energy.
Australia's AGL Energy said on Thursday it had signed a three-year deal with energy giant BP to provide easier access to electric vehicle charging points for users in New South Wales, in a bid to switch towards green energy.
Under the deal, the company and BP Pulse, the electric vehicle charging business of the London-based firm, will initially offer customers in New South Wales discounted charging rates and ultra-fast chargers when they sign up for AGL's existing 'Electric Vehicle at-home programme'.
AGL said in a statement that the agreement to develop products and services for accessible charging points would help reduce range anxiety, a common fear among EV drivers.
Shares of the country's top power producer fell 0.8% after rising about 0.1% in early trade, while BP had ended 3.7% down on Wednesday.
AGL also said that as a part of the agreement, both parties would look to explore and collaborate on the public charging infrastructure powered by renewable energy.
BP said the agreement is in line with its strategy to roll out its network of 600 BP Pulse EV charging points across Australia by 2025.

""As we transition to a low-carbon future, this agreement will empower our customers with innovative, sustainable and cost-effective EV charging solutions,"" AGL Chief Customer Officer Jo Egan said.
""I think the partnership could be good for AGL by promoting its EV program but I think the financial impact will really only be felt at the margins,"" Morgans Financial equity research analyst Max Vickerson said.
Multiple companies looking to expand their portfolios towards sustainable energy has boosted EV demand recently.
AGL had shut down the Liddell power station, one of oldest coal-fired power stations, in April after more than half a century of operations, as it looked to convert the site into a renewable energy hub."

Microsoft-backed chatbot Jugalbandi enables access to government services in Indian languages,2023-06-15T05:14:00.000000000+00:00,"Artificial intelligence-powered chatbots have been all the rage since ChatGPT launched in November last year. In fact, ChatGPT has been so popular that it passed the 100 million daily active user mark in just two months, a figure that took popular social media apps like TikTok and Instagram much longer to reach.
However, a majority of the Indian public could not access these popular chatbots owing to the language barrier. Only around 11 percent population in India speaks the English language while around 57 percent population speaks Hindi.

Since most government work is done in English, a large section of the Indian public, especially in villages, has not had difficulty in accessing government services.
Microsoft-backed new AI chatbot Jugalbandi promises to make government services easily available to all Indians in their local language using just their mobile phone.
In a blog post about Jugalbandi, Microsoft wrote, “A new generative AI-driven chatbot on mobile devices for government assistance. It can understand questions in multiple languages, whether spoken or typed. It retrieves information on relevant programs – usually written in English – and relays it back in local language.""
“Jugalbandi AI assistant is powered by language models from AI4Bharat, a government-backed initiative, and reasoning models from Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service. It is accessed through the mobile messaging system WhatsApp"" the company further wrote
While there is much concern about the risks posed by artificial intelligence technologies, it is equally true that this new age technology could also solve many of the problems that have existed for decades, if not centuries, such as corruption, bribery and red tapism.

Renault India to roll out three new models including a EV,2023-06-15T05:06:22.000000000+00:00,"Car maker Renault India will enter the bigger vehicle segment rolling out two models as well as an electric vehicle (EV) in a couple of years time, said a top company official.

New protest planned to call for release of Julian Assange,2023-06-15T05:05:00.000000000+00:00,"A protest outside Parliament is being organised to call for the release of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Campaigners and supporters will march through central London on June 24 as Assange faces extradition to the United States, where he fears being imprisoned for the rest of his life.
He has been held in London’s high-security Belmarsh Prison for over four years as he fights extradition.
Among the speakers at the Parliament Square event will be Assange’s wife, Stella, alongside a sculpture called Anything To Say, which features life-sized bronze figures of whistleblowers Edward Snowden, Assange and Chelsea Manning, each standing on their own individual chair.
Adjacent to them is an empty chair, representing the general population, encouraging everyone to “stand up instead of sit like the others”.
The sculpture has been displayed in Germany, Switzerland, France, Italy, Belgium, Serbia, and Australia.
Author and broadcaster Charles Glass conceived the idea, and it was brought to life by Italian artist Davide Dormino, who said: “As an artist, I feel I have a duty to defend freedom of speech and the right to know. That is why I have created an empty chair, which allows us to stand taller and raise ourselves.
“It changes our perspective and prompts us to look beyond what we are shown and what is hidden.”"
Erectile dysfunction: First-of-its-kind over-the-counter gel gets FDA approval,2023-06-15T05:01:00.000000000+00:00,"The gel that promises to get users an erection within 10 minutes of application has received marketing authorisation from Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Paving the way for launch of first-ever over-the-counter gel for erectile dysfunction in the US, Futura Medical's Eroxon has received marketing authorisation from Food and Drug Administration (FDA), reported CNN. The announcement was made on Monday by the pharmaceutical company. The product has been around in the UK and Belgium for some time now and has authorisation from the European Union, and parts of the Middle East also. Eroxon is a non-medicated hydro-alcoholic gel for treatment of erectile dysfunction in adult males of 22 years and above. This authorization makes it the first over-the-counter gel intended to treat erectile dysfunction. (Also read: Erectile dysfunction in males: Causes, symptoms, prevention tips, effective treatments of this sexual disorder in men)
Erectile dysfunction is a common condition affecting millions of men all over the world. According to WHO, 150 million men worldwide were estimated to have been affected by erectile dysfunction in 1995, and the figure is expected to touch 322 million in 2025. In US alone, around 30 million people are affected by the condition. Erectile dysfunction is not being able to get and keep an erection firm enough for sex. It can both be a sign of a physical or psychological condition.
How to gel works
CNN reported that the gel comes in a single-dose tube and must be applied to the head of the penis for 15 seconds prior to sex. According to FDA, upon application, the volatile components of the formulation (alcohol and water) evaporate to create a rapid, localized cooling effect on the glans penis followed by a recovering slower warming effect. This stimulates the nerve endings leading to tumescence and erection. The product claims that it can help users get an erection within 10 minutes of application. Viagra on the other hand is said to takes 30 -60 minutes to work.
How much it costs
A four-pack Eroxon costs about £24.99 in the UN, a Futura Medical spokesperson said. This would make it $31.22 in the US. However, the spokesperson wrote in an email that they don't have specific pricing details as yet, reported CNN.
What doctor says about Eroxon
According to Professor David Ralph, Consultant Urologist at University College London and past president of the European Society of Sexual Medicine, the product with its topical application, will be of particular appeal to mild to moderate ED patients who want a fast onset of action.
""The efficacy of Eroxon is remarkable and has been shown to deliver clinically meaningful benefits to most sufferers with erectile dysfunction in two Phase 3 studies but with significantly lower adverse events than current first line therapy. With topical application, it will be of particular appeal to mild to moderate ED patients who want a fast onset of action. Lack of drug interactions with prescription products will enable the product to be used with other medications such as nitrates and other cardiovascular drugs. As such the product will be of great interest to the medical community,"" states Professor Ralph on company website of Futura Medical."
Apple Vision Pro to Restrict Third-Party Camera Access,2023-06-15T05:01:00.000000000+00:00,"During the WWDC 2023 event, Apple unveiled its groundbreaking mixed-reality headset called the Apple Vision Pro. This eagerly awaited device seamlessly combines augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), providing users with an unprecedented immersive and interactive experience.
In preparation for the product launch, the Cupertino giant has confirmed that it has implemented significant measures to protect the camera feeds of the headset. Unlike Apple's other devices, third-party developers will not be granted access to the camera feeds of the Apple Vision Pro, ensuring the preservation of user privacy.
During the developer discussions at WWDC 2023, it was revealed that Apple will restrict access to the camera feeds of the Apple Vision Pro. This decision was made to prioritize user privacy and prevent any potential misuse of the camera capabilities. When apps inquire about the availability of the camera and microphone, the responses will differ from those of the iPad and iPhone.
For microphone inquiries, apps will receive a single front-facing microphone. However, when it comes to camera inquiries, apps will detect two cameras. The back camera will provide a black camera frame along with a ""no camera"" icon, indicating the absence of a functional rear camera. For front camera inquiries, apps will encounter a single composite camera. If a device lacks a spatial Persona, apps will not receive any camera frames.
The Role of Personas in Apple Vision Pro
To overcome camera restrictions and enable functionalities such as FaceTime and video calls, Apple has introduced the concept of Personas. When utilizing the Apple Vision Pro for FaceTime calls, the video feed will employ a Persona of the wearer rather than a conventional front-camera video feed.
These Personas are digital representations of the user, generated using Apple's advanced machine-learning techniques. They allow real-time display of the wearer's facial expressions and hand movements, creating a more engaging and interactive experience.
Personas play a crucial role not only in FaceTime but also in other video conferencing applications like Zoom and WebEx. By leveraging Personas, these platforms enable users to have a virtual presence during meetings and calls.
The Apple Vision Pro seamlessly integrates Personas, ensuring that users can actively participate in video calls while wearing the headset. This approach eliminates the need to point the headset towards oneself, allowing for a more natural and comfortable experience.

Royal Mail issues stamps to mark 75th anniversary of Windrush arrival,2023-06-15T05:00:23.000000000+00:00,"A special collection of stamps has been issued to mark the 75th anniversary of the arrival of the hundreds of passengers from the Caribbean to the UK on the Empire Windrush.
Eight Royal Mail stamps featuring original artworks by Black British artists were commissioned to celebrate the occasion, which will be revealed at the Black Cultural Archives in Brixton on Thursday.
The ship arrived at the Port of Tilbury, in Essex, on 21 June 1948, and its passengers disembarked a day later.
It carried 492 West Indian migrants, many of whom came to the UK, alongside people from other parts of the Commonwealth, to help in Britain’s postwar economic recovery. Many of those who came to the UK had served in the British armed forces in the second world war.
The ship and its passengers have a symbolic status as the start of the Windrush generation – Commonwealth citizens who came to work or join family in Britain between 1948 and 1971.
The illustrations were designed by five Black British artists of Caribbean heritage, including Kareen Cox, Bokiba, Tomekah George, Alvin Kofi and Emma Prempeh. Cox, Bokiba and Prempeh designed two stamps each.
The artists were commissioned to create illustrations that celebrate the contribution of the Windrush generation and their influence on life in the UK.
Each stamp represents the artist’s interpretation of the Windrush era, exploring themes of music, carnival, food, education, including Saturday schools, and politics.
Among the stamps, people are depicted playing steel pan drums with gold headdresses, dancing around a sound system and holding signs up reading “freedom” and “overcome” in protest.
Royal Mail also worked with Colin Grant, a British writer of Jamaican heritage, and Sonia Grant, an independent historian, writer, researcher and photographic exhibition curator.
Winnie Annan-Forson, the head of diversity, equity and inclusion at Royal Mail, said: “As Britain marks the 75th anniversary of the 1948 arrival of the MV Empire Windrush, we are honoured to mark this key event with a set of special stamps, featuring vibrant illustrations from talented artists that celebrate the culture and contribution of the Windrush generation and those who followed.
“We are delighted to have brought their stories to life in this special way, passing their legacy on to future generations.”
Royal Mail will also use a special postmark to stamp mail from 21 to 26 June, which will read: MV Empire Windrush, Port of Tilbury, 22nd June 1948."

Kilkenny hurling legend Brian Cody was on hand at the HSE regional offices in Lacken, Kilkenny to officially launch the annual World Elder Abuse Awareness Day today.
World Elder Abuse Awareness Day aims to raise awareness and create a culture of prevention against elder abuse. Violence and abuse against older people is a worldwide phenomenon that can take place in many forms.
ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW
The key theme for World Elder Abuse Day 2023 is around challenging all forms of ageism and standing up for the rights of older adults and the more vulnerable sections of our society.
“I am delighted to support the HSE’s South East Safeguarding Committee in officially launching their activities for World Elder Abuse Awareness Day. It is important to take a stand against all forms of ageism in society,"" said Mr Cody.
The HSE’s Safeguarding Committee in the South East are running a number of key actions in conjunction with World Elder Abuse Day 2023. This committee is made up of representatives from various statutory, community and voluntary agencies across counties Carlow, Kilkenny, South Tipperary, Waterford and Wexford.
One of the major actions is the running of an information campaign across all of the Credit Unions in the South East. This visual information campaign will be broadcasted through InfoTV in all Credit Unions and will specifically target older people and people with specific needs and requirements.
The main hope of the campaign is that vulnerable adults will reach out to the Safeguarding and Protection team when they see the information on adult abuse on InfoTV.
At the regional World Elder Abuse Awareness Day launch in Kilkenny, Grace Rothwell (Chief Officer, HSE/South East Community Healthcare) said:
“We want to get the message out to challenge all forms of ageism and to get in touch with the Safeguarding and Protection team if you have safeguarding concerns about any vulnerable adult experiencing abuse. There is a combined potential audience of 315,000 people across the Credit Union network in the south east each month. We are also targeting the postal service, libraries and many other public services with the third edition of our Safeguarding Newsletter. Safeguarding should be everyone’s business.”"
Amazon Echo Pop: A smart speaker for bedrooms and compact spaces,2023-06-15T05:00:00.000000000+00:00,"The Echo Pop, one of Amazon’s newest speakers in its line-up, is designed for smaller spaces. The company is pitching it as ideal for bedrooms and other compact locations, offering you a smart speaker that will blend in with your surroundings. It has Alexa built in, so you have access to content from subscription services such as Amazon Music, Apple Music, Spotify, Audible and others, with just a voice command or two.
The Pop has the familiar light bar that alerts you to the fact Alexa is listening, and there’s a button that will electronically disable the microphone if you have privacy concerns.
It is available in a number of different colours – lavender, teal, charcoal and white – which means the Pop really can, well, pop."

Spotify owes a $5.4 million fine to the EU. Can you guess what for?,2023-06-15T04:59:00.000000000+00:00,"Spotify is one of the top-choice apps when it comes to music streaming. The company has had a ton of experience and it has just begun to expand its feature-set. Podcasts and ebook support are just two of the new reasons the platform gives you to install it on some of the best phones out there.
But then it mishandled user data, so the EU had to fine it for $5.4 million, as AndroidHeadlines reports. Oops?
The European Union spent a long time arranging the specifics of how companies of all shapes and sizes are to handle user data. We won’t bore you with the specifics, but the requirements are hefty and ranging from where the data should be handled to how it should be stored.
This, of course, is regarding the type of data that can be associated with an individual in order to recognise them as a person. When not handled correctly, this GDPR data may be used for nasty things like mass marketing or scams, so it is actually an important topic.
The fine in question comes from the Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection and is based on a complaint from way back in 2019. Talk about a blast from the past! It turns out that at one point, Spotify failed to provide customer data upon request, which is part of a user’s rights as per EU regulations.
But then it gets even better worse: Spotify failed to explain how they were using the data in question, which raised tons of concerns. And for context: this isn’t anything weird for the EU. When a company fails to give a good reason why it needs a certain type of data, a lot of EU citizens will be eager to pursue their rights.
In addition to the fine, Spotify is expected to present the complete set of requested data to the individual who submitted the complaint — even though at this point years have passed — along with the written process for data handling.
The Swedish PDA’s investigation concluded on the bright side, as it found that Spotify is doing things properly. That, however, won’t save the company from the aforementioned fine, so Spotify responded with intent to appeal this decision in the future.

Avaloq Partners With World’s Largest Asset Manager,2023-06-15T04:54:12.000000000+00:00,"Swiss banking software maker Avaloq is partnering with Blackrock. Together, the companies aim to make their services available to private banks and wealth managers.
According to a joint announcement Wednesday, Avaloq and Blackrock are entering into a strategic partnership. Furthermore, Blackrock has acquired a minority stake in Avaloq. Details of the Deal were not disclosed.
Under the agreement, Avaloq’s software will dock onto Blackrock’s investment engine Aladdin, with the aim of giving private banks and wealth managers access to comprehensive end-to-end technology and investment solutions, it said.
Streamline Processes
Avaloq’s leading core banking is used by institutions with a total of approximately $4 trillion in assets under management and will now be linked to Blackrock’s, Aladdin.
This partnership will help us empower our clients to streamline processes, enhance risk analytics, and make more informed portfolio decisions, ultimately delivering greater value to their clients, Avaloq’s Co-CEO Martin Greweldinger, said.
With the Avaloq partnership, Blackrock will gain access to the core banking IT system which is widely used in Europe and Asia. At the same time Avaloq can benefit from Blackrock’s platform, which collects data from all accessible investments and is used to calculate the risk of around 10 percent of all assets under management in the world. In Switzerland, users include UBS.
BlackRock and Avaloq joining forces will help clients reduce the complexity and friction inherent in many of today’s digital transformations. Our combined offering will make it extremely convenient for clients to implement and adopt Aladdin Wealth’s industry-leading capabilities as it will be deeply integrated with Avaloq’s core banking solutions, Venu Krishnamurthy, Global Head of Aladdin Wealth Tech, said.
With the new offering, the two partners want to appeal to both new customers and existing users of Aladdin and the Avaloq software, they said. The joint solution, which will be sourced from the data cloud as a pure «software as a service» offering, is currently being implemented into two of Avaloq’s customers.
The combined offer also meets Swiss data protection requirements, the statment said, adding that Aladdin Wealth anonymizes the client portfolios that the technology creates on behalf of third parties.
For Avaloq in particular, the collaboration with the US giant is the first of a new slate of offerings the company is working on under the wing of its parent company NEC.
Avaloq no longer sees itself as a mere software supplier, but increasingly as a coordinating force that orchestrates emerging digital ecosystems in finance."

Meta Platforms unveils ‘human-like’ AI model for enhanced image analysis and completion,2023-06-15T04:28:00.000000000+00:00,"Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, announced on Tuesday its plans to grant researchers access to components of its new ""human-like"" artificial intelligence (AI) model. This advanced model, named I-JEPA, boasts superior accuracy in analysing and completing unfinished images compared to existing models.
Unlike other generative AI models that primarily focus on neighbouring pixels, I-JEPA utilises background knowledge about the world to fill in the missing portions of images. This unique approach aligns with the human-like reasoning advocated by Meta's esteemed AI scientist, Yann LeCun, and helps mitigate common errors often found in AI-generated images, such as hands with extra fingers.
As a renowned publisher of open-source AI research through its in-house research lab, Meta believes that sharing models developed by its researchers contributes to fostering innovation, identifying safety vulnerabilities, and reducing costs. Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, highlighted the benefits of industry standardisation on the tools they employ, allowing them to capitalise on enhancements made by others. In April, he emphasised this viewpoint during an investor discussion.
Despite concerns voiced by industry peers about the potential risks associated with AI, Meta's executives have chosen not to sign a statement endorsed by top executives from OpenAI, DeepMind, Microsoft, and Google. This statement drew parallels between the risks of AI and those of pandemics and wars.
LeCun, widely recognised as one of the ""godfathers of AI,"" actively opposes the notion of ""AI doomerism"" and advocates for the incorporation of safety checks within AI systems.

Microsoft’s co-founder Bill Gates will reportedly meet China’s Xi this week,2023-06-15T04:21:22.000000000+00:00,"Bill Gates, co-chairman of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, during the EEI 2023 event in Austin, Texas, US, on Monday, June 12, 2023.
Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images
Microsoft’s co-founder Bill Gates will be meeting Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday, Reuters reported Wednesday citing two sources familiar with the matter.
The meeting will be Xi’s first with a foreign CEO in recent years, the report said, as the Chinese leader stopped travelling overseas for almost three years after China shut its borders during the pandemic.
It could be a one-on-one meeting, Reuters said without revealing details on what they might discuss.
CNBC reached out to China’s ministry of foreign affairs but did not hear back at the time of publication.
The two men met in 2015 on the sidelines of the Boao forum, a gathering for political and business leaders, held in Hainan province. They discussed views on enhancing public health service and poverty reduction, according to China’s foreign ministry.
Gates tweeted Wednesday, saying he had landed in Beijing to “visit with partners who have been working on global health and development challenges” for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. It is his first visit since 2019.
The billionaire stepped down as Microsoft’s board chair in March 2020 to “dedicate more time to his philanthropic priorities including global health, development, education, and his increasing engagement in tackling climate change.” He left his full-time executive role at Microsoft in 2008.
Gates’ visit comes ahead of a long-awaited trip by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China this weekend, aimed at stabilizing relations between the two largest economies in the world.
Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang and Blinken spoke Wednesday and “discussed the importance of maintaining open lines of communication” in order to manage the U.S.-China relationship and “avoid miscalculation and conflict,” the U.S. State Department said.
Other foreign tech leaders — such as Apple CEO Tim Cook and Tesla CEO Elon Musk — have met with Chinese ministers in recent months.
In March, Cook met China’s minister of commerce Wang Wentao to discuss China’s reopening and broader supply chain issues. Musk met with Chinese vice premier Ding Xuexiang and other top officials in China in May, as Beijing looks to portray a friendly business environment for foreign companies amid tensions with the U.S. government."

MY E.G. Services Bhd, the developer of the public Layer-1 blockchain platform Zetrix, and Universiti Malaya (UM) yesterday announced the expansion of their research collaboration with China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT) to include the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) under the existing intergovernmental research collaboration.
This expansion is a follow-on to the “Research on Key Issues of China-Malaysia Transborder Blockchain Infrastructure and Pilot Applications” project initiated in February 2023 which was selected as part of the intergovernmental collaboration between Malaysia and China in the field of Science, Technology and Innovation. Initiated by the , Malaysia is one of 14 countries participating in the government-to-government (G2G) programme.
With the expansion, the research initiative will extend its scope to focus on leveraging AI to further streamline and optimise the cross-border trade processes, with the ultimate goal of reducing inefficiencies and improving the overall ease and speed of cross-border transactions.
""AI and Web 3 are the two key complementary technologies that will disrupt the whole spectrum of digital services,"" said TS Wong (pic), Managing Director of MYEG. ""Web3 provides the architecture that supports the deployment of AI functionalities on authenticated digital assets,"" he said, adding, ""Our partnership with UM and CAICT continues to be instrumental in our journey towards leveraging 4th Industrial Revolution technologies to transform cross border trade and settlement.""
The lead researcher at UM, Dr Saaidal Razalli Azzuhri, also highlighted the potential benefits of the expanded research initiative. ""The incorporation of AI into our ongoing research work opens up a whole new realm of possibilities. We expect that the synergistic combination of AI and blockchain technology will lead to breakthroughs that greatly enhance the efficiency and security of cross-border trade,"" Azzuhri said.
The addition of AI to the scope of this tri-partite collaboration is timely and comes even as Zetrix continues to lead the way in the deployment of services that are at the intersection of blockchain and AI. Last month, Zetrix successfully deployed its Digital Identity Service, a W3C-compliant pioneering decentralised identity service that enables online engagements with real humans to be verified and distinguished from those with AI agents."

"Sheesh, 20 House Republicans Join With Democrats to Stop Censure of the Insufferable Adam Schiff",2023-06-15T04:17:14.000000000+00:00,"Good grief, who needs Democrat firepower when you can always count on Republicans to shoot themselves to save their enemies. Twenty House Republicans joined with House Democrats to defeat a censure motion that would have triggered an investigation of the notoriously corrupt Adam Schiff (CA).
Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL), who really does seem to be a great MAGA addition to the House, created a censure motion that she advanced on Tuesday. Luna’s measure would have formally reprimanded Schiff for his conduct while Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI), where he lied about Trump-Russia intelligence.
House Speaker Kevin McCarthy blocked Schiff from the HPSCI this year and Luna’s measure would have established an ethics investigation that could have resulted in a $16,000,000 fine if they found he committed the infractions.
As ridiculous as this sounds, 20 House Republicans came quickly to Adam Schiff’s defense. Current “Republican” HPSCI Chairman Mike Turner (OH) was one of the GOP members who supported Schiff along with Republican Thomas Massie (KY) who recently endorsed Ron DeSantis. What a bunch of knuckleheads.
(WASHINGTON DC) – Republicans joined most Democrats in voting to table a measure to censure Rep. Adam Schiff for his previous leadership of the House Intelligence Committee and probes into former President Donald Trump.
The vote: The measure was tabled by a 225-196 vote, with 20 Republicans voting alongside most Democrats. Other Democratic lawmakers were lined up ready to defend the Californian on the floor, but Wednesday’s vote stops the effort from advancing to a full House vote.
Schiff’s response: “It’s a continuation of a downward spiral. There are a number of members here now who are just kind of ugly performance artists. It’s all about getting attention, doesn’t matter whether it’s good attention or bad attention, it’s all about the notoriety,” Schiff told reporters after the vote.
Republicans from districts won by President Joe Biden like Rep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.) and the current chair of the House Intelligence Committee, Mike Turner (R-Ohio), were among the Republicans who voted with Democrats to defeat the measure.
Seven lawmakers voted present on the measure, including all five Democratic members of the House Ethics Committee and Rep. George Santos (R-N.Y.). Democratic ethics panel members generally vote present on any ethics matters that come before the House. (more)"
GM to integrate Tesla charging standard in future EVs,2023-06-15T04:17:00.000000000+00:00,"Automaker General Motors (GM) has announced that it will integrate Tesla's electric vehicle (EV) charging standard in its future EVs.
""We're teaming up with Tesla to enhance your electric vehicle experience. More charging stations, less range anxiety, more sustainable journeys. It's about your convenience, not our competition,"" GM tweeted on Thursday.
Encouraging this partnership, Tesla CEO Elon Musk also tweeted, saying: ""Great to work with you.""
According to TechCrunch, GM CEO Mary Barra during a Twitter Spaces with Musk on Thursday made the official announcement.
The agreement between the former rivals comes less than two weeks after Ford announced a similar collaboration, and it suggests that other automakers may follow soon.
Owners of GM's EVs will have access to more than 12,000 Superchargers across the US and Canada, as with the Ford partnership, the report said.
""I think we have a real opportunity here to really drive this to be the unified standard for North America, which I think will even enable more mass adoption,"" Barra was quoted as saying.
She further stated that, starting in 2025, the next generation of EVs will be equipped with Tesla's charge port known as the North American Charging Standard (NACS).
In February, the USadministration revealed new initiatives to install 5,00,000 electric vehicle chargers on US roads by 2030 under its $7.5 billion plan, and as part of it, Tesla has committed to opening up 7,500 of its charging stations to non-Tesla vehicles by the end of 2024."
Erectile dysfunction: Topical gel gets FDA nod for over-the-counter marketing,2023-06-15T04:16:00.000000000+00:00,"Futura Medical has developed Eroxon, a topical gel for erectile dysfunction, which has been authorized for over-the-counter marketing in the US. The product, already available in Belgium and the UK, is the first of its kind available without a prescription.
A first-of-its-kind topical gel for the treatment of erectile dysfunction will be hitting store shelves soon, no prescription needed!
Pharmaceutical company Futura Medical, which developed the product, informed, topical gel named Eroxon has received authorization for over-the-counter marketing in the United States. The company claims, it is the first topical erectile dysfunction treatment available without the need for a prescription.
Meanwhile, US Food and Drug Administration confirmed that Eroxon has been granted a ""de novo"" classification by the US Food and Drug Administration. This classification recognizes Eroxon as a new type of product.
“FDA set a very high standard in evaluating the effectiveness and safety of De Novo Medical Devices. I am delighted that we met this standard,"" James Barder, chief executive officer of Futura Medical, said in a news release Monday.
Eroxon is already available in Belgium and the United Kingdom.
In the UK, a four-pack of Eroxon costs about £24.99, a Futura Medical spokesperson said Monday. That’s roughly about $31.22 or ₹2,500.
However, the prices in the US are still not decided and spokesperson said, as reported by CNN, ‘ it will ultimately be determined by the partner who launches Eroxon in the US’
Also, the availability of Eroxon in US stores depends on a partner but some analysts predict a possible launch in 2025.
A leaflet for the product notes that the gel comes in a single-dose tube and should be applied to the head of the penis for 15 seconds before sex. Marketing materials for the product claim that it can help users get an erection within 10 minutes of application.
The erection lasts long enough for successful sex in about 65% of people and should naturally subside, according to Eroxon’s website.
Erectile dysfunction affects approximately 30 million men in the US, causing difficulty in achieving or maintaining a firm erection for satisfactory sexual activity. Contributing factors include medical conditions (e.g., diabetes), medications (e.g., antidepressants), psychological factors, and unhealthy behaviors (e.g., smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, obesity).

FDA discovers two new outbreaks; continues investigation into another,2023-06-15T04:06:00.000000000+00:00,"The Food and Drug Administration is investigating two new outbreaks. Sources of the pathogens involved have not yet been identified.
In an outbreak of infections of Salmonella Paratyphi B var. L(+) tartrate+ there are 31 confirmed patients. The FDA reports that it has begun traceback efforts but has not reported what food or foods are being traced.
In an outbreak of infections from the microscopic cyclospora parasite, 28 patients have been confirmed. As with the Salmonella outbreak, the FDA has begun traceback efforts but has not reported what food or foods are being traced.
In ongoing outbreak news, an investigation into a multistate outbreak of hepatitis A infections has led the FDA to identify additional brands of frozen strawberries that could be contaminated. Five new products have been recalled.
The new findings include frozen strawberry products sold at Walmart, Costco, and HEB stores under the Great Value and Rader Farms brands and distributed by Willamette Valley Fruit. The company has recalled the implicated products.
The outbreak has sickened nine people across three states as of June 13. Three people have been so sick they required hospitalization. No deaths have been reported. Sick people live in Washington, Oregon, and California.
Great Value products subject to the recall are frozen mixed fruit in 4-pound bags, sliced strawberries in 4-pound bags, and antioxidant fruit blend in 2-pound bags.
The Great Value products were sold in Walmart stores in Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Iowa, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Nebraska, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Wisconsin, West Virginia, and Wyoming.
Rader Farms products subject to recall are organic Fresh Start smoothie blend in 48-ounce bags sold at Costco stores and organic berry trio in 3-pound bags sold at HEB stores.
Rader Farms’ organic Fresh Start smoothie bend was sold at Costco stores in Colorado, Texas, California, and Arizona. Rader Farms’ organic berry trio was sold at HEB stores in Texas.
There have been multiple recalls previously posted in relation to the outbreak. All of the recalls involve frozen strawberries from the same growing region in Mexico.
Previous recalls include Wawona Frozen Foods products distributed as Organic DayBreak Blend sold in Costco Wholesale stores in Arizona, California, Colorado, Utah, and Washington; California Splendor supplied products sold at Costco stores in Los Angeles and Hawaii, and to two San Diego business centers; Scenic Fruit supplied products sold in Costco, Aldi, KeHE, Vital Choice Seafood, and PCC Community Markets in specific states; and to Trader Joe’s nationwide. The retailer Meijer also issued a recall of certain frozen strawberry products in relation to the outbreak.
“This is not an exhaustive list of products or stores,” according to the Food and Drug Administration’s update. “FDA is continuing to work with the firms to identify potential additional product information.”

Sony’s WF-1000XM5 leak in their full glamour,2023-06-15T04:06:00.000000000+00:00,"Sony’s next flagship true wireless earbuds might not have been officially announced yet, but rumors about them have been going on for months. As you might know, the Sony WF-1000XM5 are gossiped to be WF-1000XM4’s successor.
So far, leaked information about these wireless earbuds has shown that they might have faster charging times than the M4. They could also be smaller and about 20% lighter than their predecessors. Some new rumors have surfaced recently, though, throwing more light on these much-anticipated wearables. Here’s what we know so far about Sony’s 2023 flagship true wireless earbuds.
To begin with, leaked details suggest that the Sony WF-1000XM5 may have a good battery performance. It’s possible to charge the earbuds via the charging case for just three minutes. Doing so should facilitate another whole hour of playtime. Taking into account their 500mAh battery, these earbuds should have an extended runtime of 24 hours. At least, that’s what rumors say. By the way, the charging case, which was initially shown as rectangular by the FCC, will most likely have rounded corners, just like that of the M4.
Like many other best wireless earbuds of today, the M5 will most likely feature an Active Noise Cancellation feature. However, there aren’t more specific details regarding this feature, so stay tuned for possible updates. Speaking of the best wireless earbuds, while you’ll probably have to wait a while to get the new M5, you can buy the very-much real Sony WF-1000XM4, currently on sale at Amazon for a limited time.
Other rumored extras of the Sony WF-1000XM5 are the Dynamic Drivers X, which should produce a crystal clear sound even in lower frequencies and not at the expense of battery life. Three microphones in each earbud will most likely capture everything, including ambient noise, and optimize the sound if necessary. So, everyone should be able to clearly hear what you say even if you are in a busy environment.
According to the leaked information, the WF-1000XM5 should use Sony’s DSEE Extreme. It’s an AI-powered feature that upscales compressed sound sources. Leaked details show that Sony should also have integrated HiRes Audio into the M5. The 2023 flagship wireless earbuds are likely to support Bluetooth 5.3 as well as Bluetooth Low Energy.
The 2023 flagship true wireless earbuds might very well become official soon. If history is any indication, we might expect Sony to release the wearables to the public sometime in August. In terms of price, there’s no reliable information yet, but we can expect them to be more expensive than most models. No wonder: they’re Sony’s 2023 flagship wireless earbuds, after all!"
Facebook AI helps police to prevent livestreamed suicides,2023-06-15T04:05:00.000000000+00:00,"AHMEDABAD: A disturbing trend of distraught individuals taking to social media sites to live-stream their suicide attempts has picked up in the state and the government is concerned. In the past 45 days alone, the cyber cell of Gujarat CID crime has received intimations of texts and videos of 17 individuals who took to Facebook and Instagram to live-stream their attempts to end their lives.
Thanks to the AI software on these sites - it scans user-generated content, identifies users at high risk for suicide and notifies cops - interventions took place in time to save their lives. Some of the recent cases were reported from Bharuch, Navsari, Bhuj and places on the outskirts of Surat, Ahmedabad and other major towns of Gujarat. The reasons for the suicide attempts were principally economic distress, relationship break-ups and disagreements between family members or friends. Of the 17 cases, 11 were from the districts in Gujarat and six cases were of migrants who had gone back to their native places in other states.
Almost all these victims could be saved with the help of an active local district police. In many cases, the local police also call ambulances to help the victims. Just recently, a severely depressed 28-year-old youth from Jambusar logged onto Facebook with a pesticide bottle in hand to live-stream his suicide attempt. Crying profusely, he took a few swigs of the toxic concoction and lay on his bed as FB streamed the goings-on. A team from Facebook immediately alerted the cyber cell of Gujarat CID crime with details of his mobile phone and location. The local police team rushed the youth to SSG Hospital in Vadodara just in time and saved his life.
Explaining the process of identification and response, state cyber cell DySP HB Tank said, ""Facebook and Instagram have special Artificial Intelligence (AI) trained software that scans videos, audio and texts and flags off any post that it rates as 'suicide risk'. A team from these social media platforms quickly analyses the flagged media content by the AI systems and then alerts our anti-bullying unit team of Gujarat CID crime."" The state cyber cell operates a 24x7 helpline which reaches out to the victim, keeps them engaged over the phone till the local police locate them via the phone IP address and location.
""There were a few cases of teenagers where they admitted that they never drank poison and were only acting. In such cases too, we alert their parents as the child had reached a state where he was contemplating suicide,"" said a senior CID crime official. The official added that there were 29 other distress calls that they had attended to on helpline 1930 owing to online harassment in the past 45 days.
""In the coming weeks, we will be taking professional help from trained psychiatrists to talk to the victims and help reduce negative emotions that drive them to suicide. This also gives us enough time to reach them,"" says Tank. He told TOI, ""The key here is coordination and active involvement of local police stations within the city commissionerate and within the district police jurisdictions, which helped us save lives.""
""We don't want to reveal the names or locations of those whom we traced and rescued as it is a sensitive matter and there is a likelihood of more people mimicking them,"" said a senior CID crime official who did not wish to be quoted. He added that in the previous two weeks nine and five individuals were saved respectively."

Colliers International Group (CIGI) Posted Better Than Expected Results in Q1,2023-06-15T04:03:00.000000000+00:00,"Kinsman Oak Capital Partners, a boutique investment firm, released its “Kinsman Oak Equity Fund” first quarter 2023 investor letter. A copy of the same can be downloaded here. The investors were expecting cooler inflation data and a subsequent pause in the Fed’s rate-hiking cycle in the first quarter. Then, suddenly the market experienced multiple regional bank failures. During the quarter, equity performance experienced a distinct sector rotation towards higher beta sectors. Technology and consumer discretionary largely outperformed defensives such as healthcare and utilities. The firm is expecting near-term volatility in the market. In addition, you can check the top 5 holdings of the fund to know its best picks in 2023.
Kinsman Oak Capital Partners highlighted stocks like Colliers International Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CIGI) in the first quarter 2023 investor letter. Headquartered in Toronto, Canada, Colliers International Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CIGI) is a commercial real estate professional and investment management services provider. On June 14, 2023, Colliers International Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CIGI) stock closed at $98.76 per share. One-month return of Colliers International Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CIGI) was 4.00%, and its shares gained 0.95% of their value over the last 52 weeks. Colliers International Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CIGI) has a market capitalization of $4.318 billion.
Kinsman Oak Capital Partners made the following comment about Colliers International Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CIGI) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:
“The Fund’s underlying holdings performed relatively in line with our expectations except for our long position in Colliers International Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CIGI) and our short position in Tesla (TSLA). Colliers has been a modest contributor to our performance year-to-date while Tesla has been a modest detractor.
Colliers has outperformed the market this year despite the stock being down ~15% from its mid-February highs. The company reported better than expected results and issued better than feared guidance, and the stock was briefly rewarded, before giving it all back over the following month. Investors are clearly worried about anything commercial real estate related given the enormous stress in the regional banking sector and a wall of debt coming due in 2024 that will require refinancing. Our belief is this will only have a slightly negative impact on Colliers EPS.”

"Spotify says distributor removed ‘Glory to Hong Kong’ from platform, as gov’t seeks to ban all forms of protest song",2023-06-15T04:00:00.000000000+00:00,"Pro-democracy protest anthem Glory to Hong Kong was removed from Spotify by the distributor, the streaming platform told HKFP, as the government seeks to ban all forms of the song and its derivatives.
The song – associated with the 2019 protests and unrest – dominated the Apple iTunes charts last week after the government sought legal injunctions to ban “unlawful acts” relating to the song, its melody, lyrics and all derivations.
The uploader, Dgx Music, said on Facebook on Wednesday that they were experiencing technical problems: “[We] are currently handling some technical issues that are irrelevant to the streaming platforms, sorry for the temporary effect. Thank you to each of our audiences.”
On Wednesday, it disappeared from the Apple Music platform and Spotify, whilst Reuters reported that versions on Facebook and Instagram also vanished. Different variations of Glory to Hong Kong still exist on Google’s YouTube and Soundcloud. But a Spotify spokesperson, who requested not to be named or directly quoted, told HKFP on Thursday that it was the artist – not the platform – that removed the song.
On Monday last week, the government submitted a writ seeking to ban the “broadcasting, performing, printing, publishing, selling, offering for sale, distributing, disseminating, displaying or reproducing [Glory to Hong Kong],” including on the internet, with a secessionist or seditious intent, or with intent to violate the national anthem law. Anyone who assists others to commit such acts relating to the song would also be criminally liable.
The Department of Justice’s legal bid for an injunction and interim injunction came days after a busker, known for performing the song, was cleared of wrongdoing.
On Monday, the Court of First Instance adjourned the injunction hearing until July 21, as the authorities appealed for anyone with an objection to come forward.
Though banned in schools, the government has previously refused to say if the song is illegal.
Anthem mix-ups
The months-long anthem saga began last November, when the protest song was heard at a Rugby Sevens game in South Korea after an intern reportedly downloaded it from the internet.
Similar mix-ups occurred at international sporting finals, including at a prizegiving ceremony of a weightlifting championship in Dubai and most recently at a February ice hockey game in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
A data scientist told HKFP this week it was too early to tell if a total ban would lead to Google, or other tech firms, withdrawing their services from the city.
In June 2020, Beijing inserted national security legislation directly into Hong Kong’s mini-constitution – bypassing the local legislature – following a year of pro-democracy protests and unrest. It criminalised subversion, secession, collusion with foreign forces and terrorist acts, which were broadly defined to include disruption to transport and other infrastructure. The move gave police sweeping new powers, alarming democrats, civil society groups and trade partners, as such laws have been used broadly to silence and punish dissidents in China. However, the authorities say it has restored stability and peace to the city.
Hong Kong’s national anthem is China’s March of the Volunteers.
Facebook’s parent company Meta, Google, Apple, Soundcloud and other streaming platforms did not respond to HKFP’s request for comment. Twitter responded to enquiries with a “poop” emoji.

The manager of a morgue at Harvard Medical School allegedly stole human body parts that had been donated for educational use, according to a federal indictment, Boston-area ABC affiliate WCVB reported Wednesday. The manager, Cedric Lodge, allegedly allowed buyers to peruse the morgue and select remains for purchase; he also brought dissected body parts back to his home and shipped them through the mail to buyers in different states.
“We are appalled to learn that something so disturbing could happen on our campus,” George Daley, dean of the faculty of medicine, and Edward Hundert, dean for medical education, wrote in a statement, according to WCVB. They called the case “an abhorrent betrayal.”
Lodge was fired last month, Daley said.

Lodge’s wife, Denise Lodge, is also accused of selling the remains; the PayPal account to which the buyers sent payments seemed to be run by her. Memos attached to the transactions read, “head number 7” in one case and “braiiiiiins” in another, WCVB reported.
The indictment also names several buyers."

"VMware's Arm hypervisor still creeping forward, slowly",2023-06-15T03:59:09.000000000+00:00,"VMware has released another update to its hypervisor for the Arm architecture, without showing any signs it will soon be productized.
The virty giant first teased ESXi for Arm way back in 2018, and in 2020 delivered a ""Fling"" – Virtzilla-speak for solid but utterly unsupported code it makes available for testing and general merriment.
In the years since, the Fling has gained support for serious Arm server CPUs – such as Ampere’s Altra and Altra Max, and the HPE ProLiant RL300 that runs them. It runs on the Raspberry Pi, too, meaning millions of hobbyists can play with VMware's core hypervisor tech.
But VMware has never signalled it plans to productize the Fling – even as key partner AWS emphasized its own Arm-powered Graviton CPUs, other hyperscale clouds adopt Ampere CPUs, and Arm itself claimed to have won five percent share of all cloudy CPUs.
Virtzilla did, however, invest in its hypervisor on the Arm platform for use in SmartNICs. That work debuted along with vSphere 8 last year and is now front and center in VMware's plan to make on-prem datacenters more efficient by offloading networking and storage chores from the CPU to Arm cores in a SmartNIC.

While the Fling was occasionally upgraded, and the SmartNIC work completed, VMware ramped up its talk of the need to create a consistent management and policy experience across multiple clouds. Yet even as interest in Arm-powered clouds increased, the virty giant didn't suggest the Fling would grow up to stretch its vision of multicloud abstraction into a multi-CPU-architecture multicloud.
Version 1.13 of the ESXi on Arm Fling – which debuted on Wednesday – doesn't give any hints that leap will happen soon. The update mostly offers bug fixes – although the addition of the ability to enable high-availability clusters of Arm servers suggests more profound evolution.
But the recently released content catalog for VMware Explore – the upcoming global gabfest – makes no mention of ESXi on Arm. That may just be VMware keeping its best news out of the public eye, as is its usual practice.
Or perhaps it's still not really sure what customers want to do with ESXi on Arm. Its blog posts announcing Fling updates sign off with requests for feedback ""to help us shape future releases"" – including the types of workloads and use cases customers want. ®"

Ubisoft Confirms the Ability to Hit Any Target in Any Order in Assassin’s Creed Mirage Q&A,2023-06-15T03:58:28.000000000+00:00,"Assassin’s Creed Mirage has gone back to its roots, focusing on the assassination aspect and shying away from the modern-day Abstergo narrative. The game is set in Baghdad during the Anarchy of Samarra in the mid-800s, and players will take on the role of young Basim Ibn Ishaq, rising through the ranks of the Hidden Ones as he experiences crucial points in his life.
The showcase presentation and behind-the-scenes look at Assassin’s Creed Mirage revealed that the game is a return to form, emphasizing stealth gameplay that was only hinted at in later RPG entries. Basim has an arsenal of tools at his disposal, including sleep-inducing blowdarts and smoke bombs, which encourage elusive gameplay and provide escape options if actions become too conspicuous.
The mechanic of crowd-blending is still present in the game, allowing players to walk among common folk unnoticed. However, Basim’s bonded eagle partner, Enkidu, plays a critical role in locating and marking targets. But, Enkidu refuses to fly in airspace controlled by a Marksman archer, adding an additional layer of strategizing for players.
While assassination remains the primary focus, Basim is not stuck with sneaking around exclusively. Combat is a valid option if he is caught out in the open, with the sword and dagger combo being the go-to weapons. The unique Assassin’s Focus ability allows Basim to chain assassinate targets within eyesight with dashing speed.
Assassin’s Creed Mirage can be enjoyed as a standalone game, but for fans seeking more context and plot threads, playing Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is recommended (including the recent DLC The Last Chapter) before diving into Mirage.
Narrative Director Sarah Beaulieu revealed in an interview that the pricing is cheaper because the game is more compact, much like the first Assassin’s Creed game. There is no modern-day Abstergo narrative in Mirage, but the Isu play a role, as do collectibles, side missions, and world events that support character development in a historical setting.
Assassin’s Creed Mirage releases on October 12th, 2023, and will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles, PC, and the Amazon Luna. The game also has a Deluxe edition with Prince of Persia-inspired DLC for $10 more and a GameStop-exclusive Collector’s Case Bundle for $149.99 that includes a Steelbook case, brooch replica, 32cm figurine of perching Basim, map, mini-artbook, and a selected soundtrack for Assassin’s Creed Mirage.

"Microsoft, Activision ask judge for speedy schedule in FTC challenge",2023-06-15T03:53:39.000000000+00:00,"WASHINGTON – Time is running out on a deadline for Microsoft to complete its $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, compelling the companies to ask a US judge on Wednesday to quickly get the ball rolling on the Federal Trade Commission’s legal bid to block the deal.
US District Judge Edward Davila on Tuesday had set a June 22-23 evidentiary hearing in San Francisco and temporarily blocked the companies from completing the deal pending a decision by another judge on the same court on whether to grant a preliminary injunction.
The hearing will focus on whether to put the deal on hold while an administrative judge considers the case. But the companies said if a temporary hold is granted they would have to drop the deal altogether because the “glacial” pace of the FTC review would make waiting impractical.
“Time is of the essence,” the companies wrote in a court filing, noting that the agreement has a termination date of July 18 and contains a $3 billion termination fee that Microsoft would have to pay.
“Let there be no doubt, a preliminary injunction ruling is the only decision that matters under these challenging deadlines.”
The FTC declined to comment.
The companies asked the court to schedule a minimum of five days for an evidentiary hearing beginning on June 22 and running through the week of June 26. They also asked for a case management conference to be set for Thursday but emphasized they were not seeking to delay a resolution by asking for a longer evidentiary hearing.
If the court grants the FTC preliminary injunction “it will effectively block the transaction because the FTC’s process is ‘glacial’ and one no substantial business transaction could ever survive,” Microsoft and Activision wrote citing a 1986 case.
The hearing in the FTC administrative proceeding is set to begin Aug. 2.
The FTC has argued the transaction would give Microsoft’s video game console Xbox exclusive access to Activision games, leaving Nintendo 7974.T consoles and Sony Group Corp’s 6758.T PlayStation out in the cold.
Microsoft’s bid to acquire the “Call of Duty” video game maker was approved by the EU in May, but British competition authorities blocked the takeover in April. – Reuters"

PMLA case: Delhi HC grants bail to Unitech promoter Sanjay Chandra's wife Preeti Chandra,2023-06-15T03:49:51.000000000+00:00,"By Express News Service
NEW DELHI: The Delhi High Court on Wednesday granted bail to Preeti Chandra, Unitech promoter Sanjay Chandra’s wife, in a multi-crore money laundering case being probed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED).
A vacation bench of Justice Jasmeet Singh, however, said the order will not take effect till June 16, after the federal agency sought time to challenge the order. “Bail application is allowed. Mr (Zoheb) Hossain appearing for ED states that the order pronounced today may not be given effect up to Friday.
At this request, the order is not given effect till June 16,” the judge ordered. The ED had registered the present case in 2018 under various sections of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act against the Unitech Group and its promoters over allegations that the owners — Sanjay Chandra and Ajay Chandra — illegally diverted over Rs 2,000 crore to Cyprus and the Cayman Islands.
Preeti Chandra had filed the bail plea before the court last year, saying she was a fashion designer and philanthropist, who has been in custody since October 4, 2021, and there were no proceeds of crime relatable to her.
The money laundering case arose from a number of Delhi Police and CBI FIRs filed by home buyers against the Unitech Group and its promoters. A charge sheet has already been filed before the trial court. It is alleged that funds collected from home buyers for housing projects were not utilised for their intended purpose and that the buyers were cheated and the accused committed the offence of money laundering."
WESH 2 Investigates: Data shows multiple crashes at tight curve along ramp to I-4,2023-06-15T03:49:00.000000000+00:00,"ORLANDO, Fla. —
Three years after it opened, WESH 2 Investigates has learned the state is trying to make a big part of the I-4 Ultimate project safer.
It's the long, looping ramp from the eastbound State Road 408 to I-4 East in downtown Orlando.
In fact, just Wednesday afternoon, Orlando police say a car carrier trailer flipped onto its side and partially off the ramp. No one was hurt.
WESH 2 Investigates uncovered records showing multiple vehicles running off the road while navigating that curve.
We started looking at the ramp from 408 to I-4 because, a lot of times, we'd see tire tracks going down the hill and road signs knocked over.
Close to a dozen cars have run off the road there, sometimes ending up in the water.
Last month, Orlando firefighters and a tow truck operator had to pull an SUV out of the retention pond at the bottom of a steep hill dropping off the ramp from eastbound 408 to eastbound I-4.

Last year, they did the same thing with another car that was stuck with its nose down in the middle of a pond.
""It's kind of dangerous,"" driver Roland Wright said.
Wright passes the retention pond almost every day.
It's at the bottom of the ramp that opened in 2020, part of the big I-4 Ultimate project.
It's a big loop with a tight turn.
And as you come around the bend, there's no barrier of any kind to block cars from going off into the grass.
""A guardrail, or the rail with the wires that run through the poles, that would be a lot better than this right here,"" Wright said.
When you drive past the area, you can often see evidence of crashes: torn-up dirt, palm trees knocked over and crews working to put signs back up after they've been run down.
WESH asked the Florida Department of Transportation for records.
Since it opened through February, they've had at least 13 crashes there.
Ten cars have gone off the ramp, and seven ended up in or near the retention pond's water.
That doesn't include the one from May.
No one from the Department of Transportation would talk on camera. They recognize there is a problem.
They installed a series of signs warning about the tight curve and advising drivers to stay at 25 mph.
They're also planning to add more this summer, including speed reduction markers, reflective markers, reflective strips and arrow signs.
In the future, they're considering putting up an electronic speed reader to tell drivers how fast they're going.
FDOT is also considering treating the surface itself to improve traction when it's wet.
But why not a guardrail? FDOT's communication manager said that could actually cause more problems, writing:
""While guardrails may prevent motorists from veering down the hill, there is also the chance that when a vehicle hits the fixed guardrail the vehicle will then block the ramp, and this could possibly lead to another crash,"" FDOT said in a statement.
Despite all the crashes there, none of them have ended with anyone being killed or injured.
""Fortunately, no one got hurt, but it shouldn't take that many cars to go over that before somebody says, 'We've got to do something about this,'"" Wright said.

Byju’s loan: Firm begins one-on-one talks with lenders,2023-06-15T03:47:43.000000000+00:00,"Express News Service
BENGALURU: Edtech firm Byju’s, embroiled in a legal tussle with its lenders over $1.2 billion term loan B (TLB), has started one-on-one talks with the lenders.
According to the people aware of the matter, the ed-tech firm has already completed a few discussions with them and these talks are to find mutually beneficial resolutions among lenders and the firm.
These discussions are being done with a majority of the lenders. Sources also said that these discussions are very crucial to the country’s most valued ed-tech firm.
Earlier it was reported that lenders were not ready to engage in the ed-tech firm’s one-on-one meetings, but now sources said they have lined up individual meetings with the lenders.
Last week, Byju’s filed a complaint in the New York Supreme Court to challenge the acceleration of the USD 1.2 billion (the firm secured this loan in November 2021) and also sought to disqualify Redwood, an investment management firm.
The company alleged that a series of predatory tactics were conducted by the lenders, led by Redwood.
The ed-tech firm also elected not to make any further payments on the loan including interest until the dispute with lenders was decided by the court. It skipped paying $40 million in interest last week.
Immediately, a group of ad hoc term loan lenders, who collectively own more than 85 per cent of the firm’s $1.2 billion term loan, called it a meritless lawsuit.
The lender group, comprised of 21 global institutional investors, had sought to work constructively with the company over the past nine months to cure its numerous defaults and it said they will continue to do so in good faith.
In the first week of June, Byju’s said it will launch the initial public offering (IPO) of Aakash in mid-2024. It said that Aakash has clocked a three-fold increase in revenue in the last two years.
The ed-tech major last month raised USD 250 million in a fresh funding round. It is yet to file its FY22 results, but sources said the company will announce the same soon."
Ethereum Survives AWS Outage Unscathed But Analysts Warn Of Future Incidents,2023-06-15T03:47:00.000000000+00:00,"Ethereum’s reliance on centralized infrastructure is under scrutiny after some U.S. users of Amazon Web Services, the world’s largest cloud hosting provider, suffered a roughly three-hour outage on Tuesday.
While Ethereum continued to operate normally despite nearly two-thirds of Ethereum validators relying on cloud hosting services, researchers fear that a similar incident in Europe could have a far greater impact on the network, as many Lido validators could have been affected. Lido is the top liquid staking provider, having amassed more than 35% of staked Ethereum.
“I imagine there would [be] some effect if AWS went down in Europe given how much Lido is in the cloud,” tweeted Evan Van Ness, an Ethereum developer. “Don’t stake with pools who run in the cloud!”
Van Ness said the outage had “zero effect” on Ethereum as it was limited to its US-EAST-1 region. The websites and point-of-sale systems of many traditional businesses were impacted, including United Airlines, Associated Press, and Toast.
Centralized Points Of Failure
The news comes as concerns regarding the centralization risks posed by some of the infrastructure underpinning the Ethereum network and its staking ecosystem have reached a fever pitch.
Researchers are desperately calling on Ethereum stakers to either solo stake or use alternative providers after Lido’s share of staked ETH surpassed one-third in recent weeks. Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s co-founder and chief scientist, recently prescribed that no single staking pool should control more than 15% of staked Ether.
Infura, the centralized Ethereum node provider, has also copped flak for emerging as a possible point of failure for the network. Infura responded last September by announcing plans to develop a decentralized version of its service this year. The company said its infrastructure has frequently processed more than 50% of daily Ethereum transactions.
While Ethereum proved resilient, the outage disrupted the operations of many web3 dApps and services.
Phantom, a popular Solana wallet, assured its users their assets were safe despite being unable to load the wallet. Players of the web3 game, Illuvium, complained they could not log in amid the outage. Users of Manifold, an NFT minting platform, said they could no longer access its website.
In December 2021, an AWS outage affecting the same region disrupted the services of top centralized exchanges Binance and Coinbase, and even the decentralized exchange dYdX."
"Alibaba aims to expand local business in Europe, president says",2023-06-15T03:44:21.000000000+00:00,"PARIS (Reuters) -Alibaba Group will make Europe top priority as it focuses on building local businesses and online platforms outside China, the president of the e-commerce giant said on Thursday.

“What we will focus more for the future is to build local businesses, so you will see something called TMall which we have in China become TMall in Europe, which means we will serve local brands and local customers in local markets,” J. Michael Evans told a technology conference in Paris.
“We have started with a pilot project in Spain which we will expand across Europe,” he said.
Alibaba announced in March it would split into six units and explore fundraising or listings for most of them, following a two-year regulatory crackdown on China’s tech sector.
Its e-commerce business is to be split, with one side covering Alibaba’s domestic-facing e-commerce marketplaces and the other its overseas e-commerce marketplaces such as Lazada, which serves Southeast Asia, and AliExpress.
Taobao and TMall are China’s dominant e-commerce marketplaces in China.
Asked about Alibaba founder Jack Ma, China’s best known entrepreneur who withdrew from public view in late 2020 after giving a speech criticising China’s regulatory system, he said Ma remained Alibaba’s biggest shareholder and still cared very much about the company.
Ma left mainland China in late 2021 for stints in Japan, Spain, Australia and Thailand, according to photographs, but returned in March a day before Alibaba announced its restructuring. He has not made any public comments during that period.
“Jack is alive, he is well, he is happy. He is teaching at a university in Tokyo and spending more time in China,” Evans said.
“He is the largest shareholder at Alibaba. This is his company, he cares as much about this company today as he did when he started it and I expect this to continue for as long as Alibaba and Jack Ma are here.”

"Google enhances shopping experience with Generative AI, gears up to outpace Amazon in e-commerce innovation",2023-06-15T03:33:00.000000000+00:00,"Google aims to compete with Amazon by leveraging generative AI technology to enhance its e-commerce offerings. This includes a ‘try-on’ feature for clothing, search and image recognition to find products, and innovative travel planning methods.
Google is entering the realm of e-commerce, aiming to outperform online shopping platforms such as Amazon.com Inc.
The tech giant, owned by Alphabet Inc., unveiled a range of features that leverage generative AI technology. These features include assisting users in assessing how clothing items will fit them regardless of body size, utilizing search and image-recognition technology to find products, and introducing innovative methods to explore travel destinations and plan routes using generative AI.
This advanced technology has the ability to generate text, images, and even videos based on basic prompts.
“We want to make Google the place for consumers to come shop, as well as the place for merchants to connect with consumers. We’ve always been committed to an open ecosystem and a healthy web, and this is one way where we’re bringing this technology to bear across merchants,"" Maria Renz, Google’s vice president of commerce, said in an interview ahead of the announcement.
Despite being the leading search engine globally, Google faces competition from Amazon in terms of product searches and research. According to a survey conducted by CivicScience, 46% of US shoppers stated that they began their product searches on Amazon, even though Google dominates the search market.
The research firm also discovered that TikTok is gaining traction in the e-commerce space, as 18% of Generation Z online shoppers prefer starting their shopping journey on the platform. Google acknowledges this trend and is targeting younger audiences with its AI-driven shopping exploration features.
Google has introduced a virtual ""try-on"" feature that allows users to visualize how clothing fits on various body types, ranging from XXS to 4XL sizes. This feature utilizes images of diverse models that Google captured during the development phase, overlaying the apparel on top of these images for a more inclusive and comprehensive representation. The aim is to provide users with a better understanding of how clothes will look and fit on different body sizes.
Google has unveiled a new service enabled by an internally developed image-based AI model. The company has also released a research paper outlining the technology behind this feature.
The virtual try-on capability considers the characteristics of clothing, such as stretching and wrinkling, to generate realistic images. Initially, the try-on feature will focus on women's tops and will be offered in collaboration with retailers like Anthropologie and Everlane. Men's clothing will be included in the feature at a later stage.
In addition, Google plans to expand its sources of information as users explore its new ""search generative experience."" This service, initially introduced at Google's I/O developers conference last month, is currently limited to the company's experimental Search Labs product. However, as users test the service, Google intends to incorporate more diverse and extensive sources of information into the experience.

Australian state bans PwC from new tax contracts for three months,2023-06-15T03:32:00.000000000+00:00,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - An Australian state on Thursday imposed a three-month ban on PricewaterhouseCoopers' (PwC) local unit from receiving new tax-related contracts - the latest repercussion to hit the firm after its misuse of confidential federal government tax plans.
PwC has come under fire after a former tax partner in the firm who was advising the Australian federal government on laws to prevent corporate tax avoidance shared confidential drafts with colleagues that were used to pitch to companies for work.
The action by New South Wales, home to Sydney and Australia's most populous state, is a ""proportionate response to the current investigations involving PwC,"" Courtney Houssos, the state's finance minister, said.
PwC will also be required to remove staff with links to the leak from all contract works for the state government - a move that the federal government has also demanded and PwC has agreed to. Last week, PwC named at least 67 current and former staff involved in the leak of government tax plans.
""I was appalled by the breach of trust that occurred with the federal government. As additional evidence comes to light we will continue to toughen our regime and protect the ... community from this behaviour,"" Houssos said in a statement.
PwC, one of the world's ""big four"" audit and advisory firms, declined to comment. Acting CEO Kristin Stubbins apologised for the leak on behalf of the firm in an open letter last month.
The Australian Federal Police is investigating the misuse of confidential government documents and four major pension funds have paused work with the firm. Some private-sector clients and government agencies have also suspended or are reviewing their dealings with PwC.

Zoho to develop large language model for generative AI,2023-06-15T03:23:51.000000000+00:00,"By Express News Service
CHENNAI: The software as a service (SaaS) provider, Zoho, plans to develop a large language model for generative artificial intelligence-based applications. Zoho is developing an LLM in the mid-to-long term, which will be capable of conversing, summarising, paraphrasing and adapting to new tasks with zero-shot learning techniques empowering AI-driven communications and knowledge discovery, said Praval Singh, vice-president of marketing and customer experiences. “We are working on our LLM but that is a long-term plan,” he said. In the short term, it aims to integrate AI-based applications in its enterprise suite.
An LLM is a deep learning algorithm that can recognise, summarise, translate, predict and generate content based on knowledge gained from massive datasets. Zoho develops and maintains data centres for its purpose, which is crucial in developing LLMs. However, they also require a huge amount of capital and talent. Analysts estimate the cost to develop a ChatGPT-like LLM would take 5 million USD.
TNIE reported Zoho’s plans to develop an LLM in April 2023. During an interaction, chief executive Sridhar Vembu said the company has around 70 engineers working on AI-based enterprise applications and it will focus on enterprise applications, not on consumer AI. He also urged the union government to develop indigenous capabilities in AI and prevent monopoly by select foreign players in the field.

Karnataka govt to object to handing over Mangaluru International Airport to Adani Group,2023-06-15T03:20:00.000000000+00:00,"BENGALURU: The Karnataka government revealed that it will write to the Centre, objecting to the decision of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) to hand over operations and management (O&M) of Mangaluru International Airport (MIA) to the Adani Group.
MB Patil, infrastructure development minister, who on Tuesday said the state government is planning to operate all new airports, told TOI: “While we cannot undo what has been done, we will question the decision. ” The minister said letters will be sent to AAI and the Centre.
“I was shocked with the decision,” he said. “It suggested the Karnataka government was not consulted on the issue. We will see how the Centre responds to handing over O&M of the airport to a private player. ”
Patil was also critical of AAI and the central government’s policy of using state resources for airports but not sharing any revenue with the state. “We pay for the land, we pay for the basic infrastructure, and then they [AAI] take over for what purpose? To distribute them to private players?” he said.
Patil said the state government pays Rs 6-8 crore as recurring costs — for water, electricity, and other amenities — to run airports. “Whyshould we pay when a subsidiary company of the state government can do the same work? We will at least have control of the airport’s capital investments,” he said. Patil said the government is also planning to suggest to AAI and the Centre that all land on which airports are constructed should be in the name of the Karnataka government. “We will give land on long-term lease and renew it on a 30-year or more basis,” he said.
Government officials say that besides the eight functional airports and the newly constructed Shivamogga airport, five more airports are in the pipeline. While Vijayapura and Hassan airports are already under construction, tenders have been issued for Raichur airport. A feasibility study is being conducted for two more airports.

Investment In Natural Hot Pools Economic Boost For Rotorua,2023-06-15T03:17:00.000000000+00:00,"Press Release: New Zealand Government
A new tourism attraction being opened today in Rotorua is expected to bring thousands more tourists to the region, Regional Development Minister Kiri Allan announced today.
The Wai-Ariki Hot Springs and Spa is today being formally opened following a five year development with $52.21 million investment from the Government. The project employed up to 250 people through construction and supported a number of local businesses.
“This is one of the biggest developments in Rotorua in the last 20 years. It is the first major purpose-built spa and bathing facility since the original Rotorua bathhouse was built over 120 years ago,” Kiri Allan said.
“This is the latest example of how the Government has made investing in the regions a strategic priority.
“We have made deliberate, targeted investments to keep our economy going, particularly during the worst of COVID-19. Since 2017, we have seen local GDP increase in the Bay of Plenty grow by 43.6% and productivity rise 2.8% - despite the challenges of a closed border and the impact that had on tourism.
“This project was near the definition of ‘shovel-ready’ when the pandemic hit, with the staged process of the build meaning much of the preliminary planning work was already out of the way.
“Our funding hasn’t just supported the creation of new tourism infrastructure, it helped maintain and create jobs and support industries at a time when it was needed most.”
Peeni Henare said the tourism data released this week, which shows an estimated 220,000 international visitors will come to the region in 2023, Rotorua is well-placed to welcome international visitors back and tap into the trillion-dollar international ‘wellness tourism’ market.
“Wellness tourism is a high-value visitor category, with total visitor spend on health and wellbeing over $1.7 m just this past April. ‘Relaxation and wellbeing’ is on the top three reasons Kiwis travel to destinations outside of where they live.
“The mineral waters of our geothermally rich regions have long been a feature of New Zealand that our visitors love,” Henare said.
“This is New Zealand’s only spa owned by mana whenua and offers services that incorporate the long standing and unique Ngāti Whakaue practices and culture into their environment and services.
“A facility like this, combined with the manaakitanga provided by Ngāti Whakaue and the team onsite providing the services, is a tourism offering of significant potential value for the region,” Peeni Henare said.

Gordon Campbell: On Losing The Ukraine War
Obviously, no-one defends the RNZ digital journalist who distorted the content and meaning of so many articles on the Ukraine war, some of them bylined by journalists who had no idea their work had been twisted to serve the needs of Kremlin propaganda, but while we're talking about the ethics of RNZ’s coverage, the tide of the war seems to be moving in favour of the Russians.

Sonos Cuts 7% Of Employees As Speaker Demand Slows; Plans To Reduce Office Spaces,2023-06-15T03:16:00.000000000+00:00,"KEY POINTS
At least 130 employees are expected to be affected by the layoffs
CEO Spence said the decision was made amid ""continued headwinds""
Sonos won a $32.5 million patent case against Google late last month
Wireless home sound system provider Sonos laid off about 7% of its workforce Wednesday as demand for the company's speakers slowed down significantly. The Santa Barbara-based company is also looking to reduce its office space in the coming months.
""On June 14, 2023, Sonos, Inc. (the ""Company"") announced a reduction in force involving approximately 7% of our employees. Decisions regarding the elimination of positions are subject to local law and consultation requirements in certain countries. The company also committed to further reducing its real estate footprint and re-evaluating certain program spend,"" Sonos said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
The company is expecting to incur around $11 to $14 million in restructuring and related costs. Around $9- $11 million of it will be dedicated to employee severance and benefits.
Sonos had 1,844 employees as of October 2022. If the headcount is the same in June, Wednesday's cuts could mean the company is letting go of at least 130 employees, The Verge estimated.
""In the face of continued headwinds, we have had to make some hard choices, including eliminating some positions and reevaluating program spend,"" Sonos CEO Patrick Spence said in a statement. ""We have acknowledged that if we started to deviate from our performance expectations, we would take action to adapt and protect profitability while still investing in our exciting product roadmap to drive future growth.""
Spence noted the company was focused on providing the necessary support to its departing employees but didn't go into detail about the severance packages.
He also did not specify what ""headwinds"" affected the company. The Verge reported there had been a noticeable slowdown in demand for speakers and home theater system products.
Sonos last cut its global workforce in 2020 ""due to the uncertainty and challenges stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.""
The speaker maker let go of approximately 12% of its global workforce at the time. It also shut down its New York retail store and six satellite offices.
""The company believes these initiatives will better align resources to provide further operating flexibility and more efficiently position the business for its long-term strategy,"" the company had said.
The latest developments came weeks after Sonos won a $32.5 million patent case against Google. A San Francisco jury decided late last month that the search engine giant infringed on one of Sonos' wireless audio device patents.
The companies previously collaborated to integrate Google's streaming music service into Sonos products but the latter accused the big tech giant of copying its technology during the project.
""This is a narrow dispute about some very specific features that are not commonly used. Of the six patents Sonos originally asserted, only one was found to be infringed, and the rest were dismissed as invalid or not infringed,"" Google said in a statement to Engadget after the jury's verdict.
Sonos, on the other hand, said it was ""deeply grateful"" that the jury upheld ""the validity of our patents."" The company also said the verdict only reaffirmed that Google was ""a serial infringer"" of Sonos' patent portfolio."
Accenture to invest $3 billion in AI,2023-06-15T03:11:00.000000000+00:00,"NEW DELHI: Accenture will invest $3 billion over three years in its Data & Artificial Intelligence (AI) practice to drive the adoption of AI across all industries for “greater growth, efficiency and resilience”.
The IT services firm will invest in assets, industry solutions, ventures, acquisitions, and ecosystem partnerships to develop new skills and capabilities across diagnostic and generative AI, said the company as it outlined its ambitious plans for AI.
Further, the company will also double its AI talent to 80,000 through a mix of hiring, acquisitions and training.
Accenture has also launched an ‘AI Navigator for Enterprises’ which will assist its clients in making the best use of AI.
“There is unprecedented interest in all areas of AI, and the substantial investment we are making in our Data & AI practice will help our clients move from interest to action to value, and in a responsible way with clear business cases,” said Julie Sweet, chair and CEO, Accenture.

Accenture joins the bandwagon of companies that are looking to enrich their services and products with generative AI, whose momentum is being driven by tech heavyweights such as Microsoft and Google.
Generative AI refers to an AI system that can generate text, audio and video based on prompts given by a user.
On Monday, Salesforce doubled its venture capital fund for generative AI startups to $500 million and launched an AI Cloud service to attract enterprises by offering AI-powered products under one roof.
China’s Lenovo has also announced to invest $1 billion over three years to drive AI adoption by enterprises. This investment includes an additional $100 million commitment to expand the Lenovo AI Innovators program."
Forget waterproof – Samsung’s earbuds seem to be fireproof,2023-06-15T03:00:00.000000000+00:00,"Earbuds have a knack for getting bashed about and while there are some that are more indestructible than others, the appear to be one of the toughest.
A recent tweet from the tech blogger Maaz Perwez reveals that even after being burnt in a house fire, the buds are still working, including their location-finding function. And while the charging functionality of the buds is fried, Perwez did say that they are “built like a tank”.
Seems like the UWB of Galaxy Buds 2 Pro for Smart Things find works as intended. Btw my house was burnt due to a short circuit along with that my laptop watch and buds were also burnt. My buds are working for now but I am not able to charge them. Buds 2 Pro is built like a tank pic.twitter.com/MgmA5a9rCL

Even more surprising is the fact that Samsung’s SmartThings Find – its service for locating Galaxy devices – also worked to locate them. It’s how Perwez says that he was able to find them in the rubble.
The phrase ‘rising like a phoenix from the ashes’ comes to mind when picturing him finding the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro in working condition. One of the key functionalities of the SmartThings Find service is that it works when offline. And this recent story is the best proof we have of this.
If you’re not familiar with SmartThings Find, in 2020. Like Apple’s , it offers an offline feature that helps you find your device. It works by using the signal of other Galaxy devices to send the location of your lost earbuds.
Rising from the ashes
As one of the out there – in our review, we went as far to say that they’re easily the best Samsung Galaxy Buds yet – it’s not entirely surprising that the Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro are built as solid as they sound.
We don’t yet have a ‘best fireproof earbuds’ guide but if we did these would be at the top of our list. We (thankfully) don’t often test how fire retardant earbuds are – there’s testing a product, then there’s putting a product through its paces.

"Flipkart, PhonePe could be $100 billion businesses in India, Walmart CFO says",2023-06-15T02:53:00.000000000+00:00,"Walmart's Flipkart marketplace and PhonePe payments business in India has the potential to become $100 billion enterprises, driven by robust growth, according to the retailer's Chief Financial Officer, John David Rainey. Speaking at an investor conference, Rainey highlighted the strong performance of Flipkart and PhonePe as crucial factors in achieving Walmart's goal of doubling its gross merchandise volume in foreign markets to $200 billion within five years.
While Walmart does not disclose specific sales figures for Flipkart and PhonePe, recent months have seen company executives highlight the significance of these two businesses. Walmart's international chief has previously referred to India's massive population of 1.4 billion as a ""significant"" opportunity for the retail giant.
In the most recent quarter, which ended on April 30, Walmart reported double-digit sales growth for its Flipkart business. This growth was driven by the acquisition of new shoppers in several cities and a substantial 50 per cent surge in advertising sales. Flipkart, valued at over $40 billion in 2022, ranks among India's most valuable startups.
Walmart also expressed enthusiasm for PhonePe's exceptional performance. The payments business achieved an annualised payment value of $1 trillion, primarily facilitated by the Unified Payments Interface—a highly popular real-time payment method in India. As of December, PhonePe held a dominant 46 per cent share of the payments market, according to the National Payments Corporation of India.
Additionally, PhonePe boasts an impressive user base of 400 million registered customers. To solidify its position as India's most valuable payments startup, Walmart injected an additional $200 million into PhonePe in March, valuing the business at $12 billion.
Rainey stated, ""It is not far-fetched to envision both these businesses becoming $100 billion enterprises in the future.""

's digital payment division aims to leverage its traditional mobile wallet service to reestablish itself in the consumer payment market in India.
What Happened? Amazon believes interoperability — the ability of its wallet to interact with any QR code in India — will boost transactions and somewhat flip its fortunes, according to an Economic Times report.
As of April 2023, Amazon Pay had established 62.8 million wallets, according to Reserve Bank of India data.
However, only 3.8 million transactions were reported that month. In contrast, Paytm Payments Bank, an Indian rival, boasts more than 500 million wallets.
Amazon Pay also lags in Unified Payments Interface (UPI)-based transactions, recording 57 million transactions in May 2023. Nevertheless, Amazon aims to capitalize on its 100+ million registered users in India for increased usage of its platform.

Wallet Play: Vikas Bansal, director at Amazon Pay India, acknowledged that the company’s challenge lies in enhancing transaction share among its extensive customer base.
To address this, Amazon India created a shortcut to facilitate direct access to the Amazon Pay micro app from the home screen, potentially promoting user adoption.
Moreover, Amazon plans to encourage its Indian wallet customers to use the app more frequently for daily transactions. Bansal emphasized that over 70% of daily UPI transactions are below INR 500 ($6.10) suggesting many users prefer using a wallet for these payments to keep their bank accounts uncluttered.
Interestingly, except for Alphabet Inc. GOOGL GOOG subsidiary Google, both Amazon and WhatsApp — owned by Meta Platforms, have struggled to affect India’s consumer payments business in a big way.

"HC bail to Unitech promoter's wife, but no relief till Fri",2023-06-15T02:36:00.000000000+00:00,"NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court on Wednesday granted bail to Preeti Chandra, the wife of Unitech promoter Sanjay Chandra, in a money laundering case probed by the Enforcement Directorate. However, at the request of ED, the single-judge bench of Justice Jasmeet Singh said that the order be not given effect to till Friday.
As the court pronounced the order, ED counsel Zoheb Hossain requested that the order may not be given effect to till June 16 as the agency has to challenge the same. The appeal will become infructuous, Hossain added.
The trial court denied Preeti Chandra bail in November last year taking note of the ""enormity of the transactions and seriousness of the allegations.""
ED alleged that Preeti Chandra received proceeds of crime amounting to Rs 107 crore in her company but did not disclose the ultimate usage of the amount in question.
The money laundering case was filed after FIRs were filed by Delhi Police and Central Bureau of Investigation on the basis of complaints from homebuyers against the Unitech Group and its promoters.
ED had filed a PMLA case in the year 2021 against Unitech Group and its promoters over allegations that the owners, namely Sanjay and Ajay Chandra illegally diverted more than Rs 2,000 crore to Cyprus and the Cayman Islands. A chargesheet was filed in the case by ED."

BBC Presenter Victoria Coren Mitchell Accuses New York Times Of Cloning Her Cult Quiz ‘Only Connect’,2023-06-15T02:32:00.000000000+00:00,"She’s turned her seemingly esoteric quiz into one of the UK’s most beloved game shows, and now Victoria Coren Mitchell has accused The New York Times of copying the format.
The presenter said a newly-launched Times quiz, titled Connections, bears a striking similarity to Only Connect, the BBC show she has fronted since 2008.
In Connections, players must group words that share a comment thread. Only Connect, meanwhile, tasks contestants with making connections between apparently unconnected things.

Mike Turner, a question setter on Only Connect, added: “If you need a hand at all, I’ve written over 750 of these for Only Connect.”
The Times has been contacted for comment. Banijay, the European production giant that owns Only Connect, is understood to be aware of the similarities but declined to comment. The BBC declined to comment.
Only Connect first launched on BBC4 before moving to BBC2 and is known for being one of the UK’s toughest quizzes. Coren Mitchell has helped the show win millions of fans with her quips at the expense of contestants and her extravagant costumes for special episodes."
BBC announces two new NI documentaries centring around catfishing and online scams,2023-06-15T02:31:00.000000000+00:00,"Two new Northern Ireland-based documentaries have been co-commissioned for BBC Three and BBC NI, which both centre around social media and scams.
‘Bait’, produced by Belfast-based company DoubleBand Films, is a three-part series that tells the devastating story of how a university student from Northern Ireland became the UK’s most prolific predatory ‘catfish.’
Told from multiple perspectives, the programme uncovers the criminal investigation to bring Newry man Alexander McCartney to justice, and reveals the catastrophic impact on victims and their families as well as those who knew him best.
In 2018, the PSNI were first made aware of the case when Scottish police alerted them to a ‘catfish' incident involving inappropriate images of a young girl.

Detectives began an investigation into the young criminal’s use of fake profiles to befriend hundreds of victims that ended up stretching across the world as far as America and New Zealand.
Meanwhile, ‘Instascam - Give me Back my Face’ will share the story of Belfast man James Blake, who began getting messages from people accusing him of conning them out of tens of thousands of pounds, after his social media accounts were scraped.
James is currently building himself a multi-million pound digital marketing business from scratch and has been sharing his flashy lifestyle on Instagram; fancy clothes, fast cars, exclusive parties and thousands of followers.
As the 29-year-old sets out to try and clear his name, he discovers a dark modern-day-crime where organised-crime-gangs are using the very latest technology to trick victims out of their life-savings.
As James attempts to get his online identity back, he’ll discover that it’s not only those being conned who are the victims here - many of those carrying out the con are suffering even more at the hands of gangs running romance-scams estimated to have netted around £100m from victims in the UK alone last year.
Both documentaries were announced on Wednesday morning by the BBC at Sheffield DocFest."
"UTI AMC stake sale: State Bank of India (SBI), LIC, Punjab National Bank, and Bank of Baroda look for bids, says report",2023-06-15T02:30:00.000000000+00:00,"State Bank of India (SBI), Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), Punjab National Bank (PNB), and Bank of Baroda (BoB) are mulling seeking bids for selling their stake in UTI Asset Management Company (AMC), Economic Times (ET) reported. These four entities together own a 45.16% stake in UTI AMC.
The report also mentioned that earlier the Tata Group was believed to be in advanced talks to buy a majority stake in UTI AMC, but the deal did not materialise.
UTI Asset Management Company reported 59 per cent jump in profit after tax (PAT) at ₹86 crore for the three months ended March 2023.
In comparison, the company posted a PAT of ₹54 crore for the same quarter a year ago, UTI AMC said in a regulatory filing.
As of March 2023, UTI AMC's assets under management stood at ₹15.56 lakh crore.
Earlier in 2019, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) had asked LIC, SBI, and BoB to reduce their stakes in UTI Asset Management Co. Ltd by December 2020. Sebi’s cross-holding norms for mutual funds say the sponsor of one AMC cannot hold more than 10% in another.
Under Section 7B of the Sebi (Mutual Funds) (Amendment) Regulation, 2018, the market regulator had mandated all mutual funds to comply with the norms by March 2019.
In other news, India’s markets regulator is unlikely to give special exemption to mutual funds if they breach the norms for maximum permitted holdings in security after the merger of HDFC Bank and HDFC, Reuters reported.
HDFC Bank and HDFC are set to conclude a merger in the next few weeks to create India's second-largest financial institution by assets after the State Bank of India.
As per the rules of SEBI, a mutual fund scheme cannot invest more than 10% in a single security. However, exchange-traded funds and funds that invest in particular sectors are exempt."
Music publishers sue Twitter for allowing copyrighted songs,2023-06-15T02:28:00.000000000+00:00,"A group of 17 music publishers sued Twitter in Nashville, Tennessee, federal court on Wednesday, accusing the company of enabling thousands of copyright violations by allowing users to post music without a license.
Twitter drives user engagement with ""countless infringing copies of musical compositions,"" the lawsuit said.
Members of the National Music Publishers' Association, including Sony Music Publishing, BMG Rights Management and Universal Music Publishing Group, are seeking more than $250 million in damages for alleged infringement of nearly 1,700 copyrights.
The lawsuit said the longstanding infringement has gotten worse since Elon Musk bought Twitter in October, and that other major platforms like TikTok, Facebook and YouTube properly license music from the publishers.
Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
NMPA President David Israelite said in a statement that Twitter ""stands alone as the largest social media platform that has completely refused to license the millions of songs on its service.""
Twitter ""routinely ignores"" repeat infringement by users who post tweets that contain unlicensed music, the lawsuit said. The publishers said Twitter encourages user infringement, which increases engagement and ad revenues while giving it an ""unfair advantage"" over platforms that pay for music licenses.
""Twitter's internal affairs regarding matters pertinent to this case are in disarray,"" the publishers said, noting deep cuts to the company's legal and trust-and-safety teams since Musk took control.

Maruti Suzuki Bets On Jimny To Break Into SUV Big League,2023-06-15T02:24:00.000000000+00:00,"With the launch of the new Jimny, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. is aiming to increase its market share in the SUV segment, according to senior executive officer, marketing and sales Shashank Srivastava.
The company aims to increase its share in the SUVs to 24-25%, Srivastava told BQ Prime's Sajeet Manghat. It currently has 31,000 bookings of the new five-door Jimny SUV, he said.
There are two variants of Jimny—manual transmission and automatic transmission. Roughly 50% bookings are for manual and 50% are for the automatic variant, Srivastava said.
The Road Ahead
The SUV segment has been growing, and customers' preferences are going towards that shape of vehicle, according to Srivastava. ""The segment, about four years ago, was only about 26% of the market, and today it is almost 45% of the market, clearly the largest.""
ADVERTISEMENT
""We have 65% of the market share in the non-SUV segments. Last year, the company had 12.3% of the SUV market share, with the overall share being under 45%,"" he said.
Maruti Suzuki targets a 50% share in the overall car market in the medium term. To achieve this, the company needs to increase its share in the SUV segment, Srivastava said.
On the new multi-purpose vehicle that Maruti is launching on July 5, he said the company will be competing in the segment with seven other products. ""It is going to be very challenging and interesting.""

"Vodafone CEO secures early win, but long road ahead on the deal front",2023-06-15T02:18:00.000000000+00:00,"By Paul Sandle and Muvija M
LONDON: Vodafone boss Margherita Della Valle has bagged her first win with a merger deal in Britain, but the time it took to get there and the tortuous road ahead shows the scale of the challenge she faces to turn around the telecoms group.
Della Valle was appointed chief executive in late April, tasked with overhauling the business in key European markets and halt a slide in performance that has left its share price languishing at 25-year lows.
She has struck in Britain first, announcing on Wednesday a 15 billion pound ($19 billion) merger of its UK mobile operations with those of CK Hutchison to form a new market leader.
The two sides first revealed they were in talks in October, 2022. They hope to close the deal, if they can secure regulatory and political approval, by the end of 2024, meaning they must wait another 18 months before any synergy savings or improvement in performance can start to hit the bottom line.
""For Vodafone this transaction is a game changer in our home market,"" Della Valle, a 29-year company veteran, told reporters. Under the terms, Vodafone could eventually buy out the Hong Kong-based conglomerate if they both agree.
The announcement is likely to bring some relief to a management team that has struggled to get a break in recent months, with weak trading in Germany, Spain and Italy, plus a lack of action on the deal front, leading to former boss Nick Read agreeing to step down last year.
One large institutional investor told Reuters they appreciated the changes Della Valle was pursuing but they had struggled to understand why the British deal had taken so long to come together and said they wanted to see more action soon.
Speaking ahead of the announcement, the investor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the CEO knew she had a year coming up that was ""ultimately career defining"".
Many investors want Vodafone to replicate similar deals across markets such as Italy and Spain, where fierce competition has eaten into returns at a time when telecom groups are spending heavily to invest in ever faster networks.
That is likely to take time, but Kester Mann, a director at CCS Insight, said the British announcement would give Della Valle a boost.
""She has shown clear intent to make changes at Vodafone as she bids to turn the embattled company's performance around,"" he said. ""Securing approval for a tie-up with (Hutchison's) Three would be a major boost to her early tenure.""
